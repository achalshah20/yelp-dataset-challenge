Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.",4

2,fFSoGV46Yxuwbr3fHNuZig,Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.,5

CONS: The pizza was not good.  Pre-formed crust, NOT fresh dough.  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER.  

I guess the name says it all.  Get the hoagie, pass on the pizza.",3
4,AEyiQ_Y44isJmNbMTyoMKQ,"First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there's no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74

So I'm thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12"" hoagie these will be awesome. 

I was sadly mistaken. 

The only reason I didn't give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. 

So on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. 

Second, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. 
No cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I've ever eaten. 
I'm not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. 
Check out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.",2
