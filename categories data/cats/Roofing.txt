"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!) "When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck. Once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time. I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them   few days later they were asking for 1092 for 1 window that was tested for lead out of 28 Windows they only tested one! They charged me 39 a window but only tested one I can't believe they changed there tune payed in full! I would never recommend them they should be ashamed of themselves ! They even called an attorney and didn't even give me a field report to tell me that each window was tested they assumed that if one window had lead that all 27 had it to and charged us for it! Never again!" My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them "They did a good job yet feel they were in cohoots with covering for the dishonest main contractor (who went from great to horrible in one day) and have to wonder why they have to refer so many folks to the chimney experts; are they sharing referral fees or something?  I would not recommend them I recommend that you use ANY other company for roofing than this one. Again
