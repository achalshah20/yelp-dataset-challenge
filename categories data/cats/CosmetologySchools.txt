I recommend them 100% and will DEFINITELY be back again!" "The place itself is a bit old school but the people working inside were super helpful and amazing to talk too. I am not normally a person who likes to chat it up with the people working but they sure made me feel comfortable. I went on a Tuesday night and I was there for three hours getting a haircut Bottom line....I wouldn't go back there if they were offering FREE services!!" VERY DISAPPOINTED & WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE."  to the previous people that say they didn't learn anything; I feel sorry for them.  If you take initiative to learn and get the most out of it; you will. I highly recommend this school & look forward to going to school everyday!"  need to learn a bit about customer service. We are your clients and help you teach your students. Get off your high horse. I won't be back." Learn a little customer service and teach your students. Isn't that what they are paying for and maybe get rid of the dead weight that gives your salon a bad name. If it were not for one or two teachers you would have a better rating"
