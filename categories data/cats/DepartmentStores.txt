 Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad  which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town."  but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!"  I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often." Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question? this store is sadly not in business any more  Target is my favorite place to shop for those things."  etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here." And I see you have the retro tees too.  You know:  Yes http:  www.dovenetq.net.au ~mahayes Graphics YesLogoFullCircle1.jpg Boston http:  www.vinylrecords.ch B BO Boston Boston boston-63.jpg Led Zeppelin http:  henrikfalck.com blog uploaded_images LedZeppelinLedZeppelinalbumcover-716782.jpg  We know what ""retro tee"" means:  faux aged OMG. Target is my fav store ever. I love the staff they are also so helpful and friendly. They recognize me being there quite often!!! I also greatly appreciate being able to use a target coupon AND a manufacture coupon!!!!!  I save so much money shopping  there and now I save 5% everyday using my target debit card!!!!! Ah I love this store!!!!!!! The only downside I can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  I prefer not to vomit as soon as I walk into a store "This is a really great pharmacy - friendly  but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them  only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service."  and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty."  and I didn't wait in long to long so I'm happy."  it's pretty much so like any other Target. The lines were crazy long today and I was only buying one thing. I was relieved when they sent a few more cashiers in and opened up some more lines. It definitely expedited what was looking to be a very long wait." I like Target enough to return. I like it enough to pass by any Walmart that my throw itself in my path. Does that mean I love Target? No  and you can find some good deals. I like how they have easy to find browse clearance sections at the end of aisles. If you have their target card then some of the sales give you gift cards for a purchase and you get 5% off all your purchases with that card. I still love you Target. Always." Save your gas if your not close but if you need something quick The one saving grace of most of the Target stores including this one is the check out lines are very fast and efficient.  That and the aisles are large enough to negotiate around because they seem wide enough that you don't feel so tight like at Walmart." I find this target to be average.. although im here quite a bit. I guess im just used to where everything is at the east liberty location.. i always feel so lost here. It's decent though. the checkout lines move quickly "Went here last saturday and the service to customers is great. Sure it was busy but workers could be found in almost every department and even anwser questions. I love that. I should say props to Mike There is plenty of parking here and the lines move quickly." ISKLP0qxApATxRlUDob6Cg "This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money This Bed Bath & Beyond seems like your average store location. I don't have anything too bad or too exciting to say about this location... descent products and descent service. I would just recommend taking all of your Bed Bath & Beyond coupons with you when shopping because staff will help you combine them as best as possible. Overall I will be back many  but for some reason an employee did mine for free.  Only downside is that some of the gift wrapping that some of the wrapping items have the store name on it  yet nice store. The associates are nice and helpful. Not much else to say about this particular store. Just a pleasure to purchase from..."  and service our clients. Maybe I'm reaching too high with BBB. I feel they expect YOU to greet THEM and make THEM feel comfortable. I never could understand this mentality. Maybe they should pay ME for this responsibility." I have a Keurig Vue and this is the only store I've been able to find that carries Vue cups. The only other place I can find them is online and I'm not a morning person. So waiting a week for shipping is just not an option sometimes. Aside from that I feel like all they jam pack the store full of everything they can.  Not that that's a bad thing but it does make it hard to find what your looking for sometimes." The prices are competitive and there's no reason to pay full price for your k cups "This is my go to for towels and bathroom accessories.  They also have very affordable bedspreads and down pillows.  It is a nice place to shop with helpful employees. I hate searching for and saving coupons and receipts and would prefer that retail establishments just keep their prices low.  The cost in time and efficiency in managing coupons "This is a stop I hit whenever I head to the Waterfront. It's a pretty large store with lots of goodies. Yes I'll definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals they'll have then!"  store is clean and check outs are quick."  there are those times that you may not find anything as well.  So really don't get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item."  be it bedding or cookware that you need. Plus they have great decorative items as well. It's a great place to not only shop for yourself but for gifts. They have the best selection of frames around. It's all at great prices." Good for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area." "This store is absolutely horrid (as is the majority of the shopping complex in which it is located). It is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow. Most Wal-Mart stores have a checkout speed twice as fast as this Kmart "Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly Are employees required to be grumpy here? They all look like they hate their job. The store is well stocked but the prices are usually higher than competitors. I think everything I've ever bought that has received a compliment was purchased at this particular store; I thought all Marshalls were this nice.  Alas I like this location because it's Downtown and I can shop on my lunch hour." I remember now why I don't go to Burlington Coat Factory." It's alright. The clothes are cute and the prices are good. But the biggest size is a 2X. I saw some really cute shirts but they wouldn't fit because my chest is too big. I love this store. It is always busy and it is kinda ghetto but on a positive note the layout of the store is pretty ok because I still find amazing deals.:) "This Burlington is always on and popping. At times I can get annoyed with this store because they never seem to have more than 2 lines opens for checking out. This Burlington Downtown has a better selection of clothes and shoes then it's sister store in North Hills.  Almost anything I need clothes and shoes wise I go to find in Burlington they also have bedding "Stopped here on my lunch today to do a little shopping.  Found a cute little sundress for 60% off retail price.  Found a shirt my husband Rick had been looking for too.  So yeah  but you'll have that downtown at an off-price store.."  it is well maintained and has lots of items. The clothing clearance racks are usually stocked up with stuff for all sizes. The only minor issue is that some of the dressing rooms for the women's fitting rooms don't have locks or don't have mirrors so watch out for that but the rooms are clean and there is always a employee in that section to take care of things."   Alexander mcqueen.  200 dollar shoes for 35-40 bucks! Associates very friendly as well!" "This review from me is way too late! I used to shop here all the time in college. I went to Duquesne  as you can usually find him singing and chatting up his customers. I love the energy  even if there were other stores lol. It's by far the best Burlington I've ever been to. Their plus size selection is fabulous! I also can't leave there without a new purse!" Wow! I did not know the concept behind Marshalls!?  So many deals and for such small prices!! I was absolutley amazed!  Go here! get some deals before the rest of the world goes and buys all the good deals!  but you may not always find what you want or need here." If you can't find anything check out the near by TJ Maxx as both stores are owned by the same company."  etc. They keep it as organized and straightened as possible. Found multiple great buys here and I will be back! The only section I'm never impressed with is the beauty section. It's definitely very picked over and most of the stuff is discontinued for good reason but I always find better things here than at TJ Maxx or Ross. Highly recommend you stop in!"  but really South Park's is the best in the area and sets the bar high so the others just fall a bit short in comparison.  Sales associates are nice The reason I'm giving the Belk 4 stars is their employees were all super nice.  The little old lady ringing me up was sweet.  Most of the people at the Clinique counter. however  skirts and shirts for summer.  The store seems much brighter and inviting than before and they are definitely deals to be had.  The young lady that assisted me was very nice and helpful.  I will definitely return (again and again)." Belk at Carolina Place always has amazing customer service. They often compensate when you forget a coupon at the register. "I called because I needed help figuring out what I had returned from my wedding registry and the lady on the phone is extremely figity and asks for my number to call me back. While I'm telling her my number she cuts me off before I'm even finished telling her my number and she hangs up.....I called back and said "" I was just speaking to someone on the phone and couldn't finish my sentence before getting hung  up on"" as I can tell it's the same lady...she then says ""oh I'm sorry"" like it wasn't her. I then left a message on the store managers voicemail and I get a call 10 min ago explaining what happened and all she says is ""so what is it exactly you needed help with"" um I called to complain Great store lots of choices .... Sales and coupons available daily - something I'd always on count on. Finding a sale isn't hard .... Go to Belk enjoy the sales ... When I was returning the dress a different lady helped me and when I showed her the receipt and explained that when I purchased the dress I was told it would be free shipping. She just said "Bra shopping is slightly more fun than a root canal. Cindy in the Intimates department at Belk helped me find the right size and asked the right questions to be able to recommend brands. Clearly very knowledgeable. Service would have been a bit better if they had more staff. And I object to bra prices being so high "Awesome experience at this Belk!!! Had to come get a very specific outfit for a wedding I'm in and the sales associate  and housewares. I needed to get a plant as a last minute gift for a friend (never show up empty handed!). I had been planning to hit the home and garden department at the store further back in the mall  so I had to head back over... I said hi and excused myself since they were deep in the throes of their conversation and asked if anyone knew where they kept the scales... Out of the four people Until next time....TTFN!!"  but other than a couple of employees stocking shelves the store seemed to be a bit of a ghost town." This store has plenty of parking spaces. Store is pretty organized. Friendly staff. It's also a plus that they have price scanners too!  we had to wait on line with one person in front of us for well over 10 minutes. No one knows what they are doing or how to process a transaction. Managers are not available for assistance either. Never will be coming back here again. Worst customer service ever!" "Not a bad store - just doesn't have the customer traffic that would make the experience ""great"". Walked around store looking for an employee to help me and after covering what  I considered more than 1 2 the store I finally called the store on my cell and asked an employee on the phone if they had what I was in search of ... The employee told me where to find it and actually offered to meet me there to help me.  Good customer service - just not enough staff ... That is why Kmart will get a bad rap- not enough staff . The products they carry are nice - store was clean and shopping was easy once I got help." "wal mart killed k mart and most others such as caldors  but the sales associate came to my rescue and assured me that we could try to order them and I'd have them within the week. She held up the line in order to cater to me and called around searching for which other stores carried that size until she found it. As I was told Don't go out of business I ended up shopping online and found a couple items that I am quite pleased with.  I will say that many items were out of stock online; this is a clear indication that JCP has ramped up their merchandise quality and many haven taken notice and are reaping the benefits.  Shop JCP online to take your time viewing the merchandise.  If you are up to it Very pleasant experience and definitely worth it to save $8." This review is for the salon. I was looking to get my hair cut but no place could fit me in. I stopped by jcpenney where they made me an appointment with Chris. He was awesome. listened to what I wanted and gave me a great cut for under $40. I will definitely be back! Floor staff is helpful. I tend to find it challenging figuring out where to pay." H0S3kzLoL41WUjYe7mnVgw "I like this Dillard's because it is easy to get in and out of.  I also have found quite a few good deals on sale items at this store.  On my last couple of shopping trips here  they do offer great variety of brands of clothings. And they do have good sales most of the time. Sad part is they don't offer any other form of discounts Dillard's seems a little dated and like it could use a facelift and some new lighting.  I don't think they have done anything with this store since it opened 20+ years ago.  That is not to say the merchandise isn't up-to-date  I was reminded of him and even wrote about him there as a comparison to how customer service SHOULD be! He's always wearing a smile and makes you feel important. My dad shops here often "Best deal you will find on tires anywhere.  Be careful with the groceries though - some are way more than what you would pay at a grocery store.  Store brand medications are also the cheapest you'll find anywhere.  The best thing is that while waiting for your tires to be installed "It's a Sam's Club duh!  It's basically a Wal-Mart on steroids.  Never venture here on the weekends Love this place! On Saturdays you can sample your way through getting full! The rotissere Chicken salad is the best I have ever had! I love the oven roasted chicken wings in the freezer section (this is the only place you can get them) Go early Saturdays... free samples of a lot of different things." "Researched the three chains of warehouse style stores to figure which would be the best deal. Went to the sams club website which stated I would be allowed to obtain a one day pass with a surcharge. I needed something specific but was interested in obtaining a membership to knee of the three clubs. After driving the 25 miles to get to the club I was told that I had to come with a printout of the actual day pass. I tried to tell the employee that the website stated I did not need to bring a pass but visit the customer service desk and would receive one. I was ready total pay whatever surcharge I needed to pay. After speaking to a second person at customer service and told that "" they ran out of day passes""  and shoddy employment practices. But Sam's Mart has relatively short queues I am a big fan of Sam's Club! We usually go at least every month or so to stock the pantry and freezer with kids school snacks and meats. I agree there are certain items you have to watch out for but if you are like me and research the ads and shop around for the best deals it helps.  even when I asked to speak to a manager. I have never in my life encountered such awful customer service. I told them to forget it and that I was going to get cakes through a local grocery store chain... and I did. We will never use Sam's Club again." I am so sick of Walmart and Sam's Club associates. My visit today at Sam's Club was beyond aggravating. I understand you have to have a membership to shop and I was going to apply for one today but soon as I walked in the door which was about 3:00pm this lady or so call greeter was very disrespectful and didn't even give me a chance to go get me a membership card. She kept asking if I had a card and I said no I going to apply for one right now. I wanted to cuss her out so bad but I didn't. And the next time she does something like that again I will tell her about herself. Both Walmart and Sam's Club need to learn valuable customer service. "Wally World !!! They have it all here ! Nice selection Walmart on steroids... Customer service is a joke. I cancelled my Sam's membership because of the lack of customer service at this store! Sam's Club is fine as long as you don't ever have to interact with an employee. This location is pretty well stocked." Horrible customer service! Asked for help with something the girl would rather have fun on her phone and talking to other employees. Said something to manager and they didn't care . I do like Sams club but must give them one star for the rude people that work at the optical center. I called to see if they had my contacts in stock and asked her to repeat herself and she ended up screaming into the phone. Extremely rude. Sam's club is the best. Also get what I need and get out pretty quickly. The only negative thing I can say is some times the line to get out the door gets long. The rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods shoes electronics Yep it's in the hood and no I don't even think twice about shopping here for toys during the Christmas season for 2 simple reasons 1) I don't have to fight for a parking spot and 2) there's hardly ever a crowd.....nuff said and see ya next year!.  got a discount owith my Sears points (from purchasing kids clothing shoes) so that made me very happy.  It took maybe 3-4 hours for them to process my order and notify me that it was ready for pickup.  I went in  they'll honor it. Just today I brought back in a colander that I couldn't get the sticky price tag off of (why do they do that?) and an ironing board without the packaging Still have a small problem with the fact that I am always finding myself using their 20% coupons they send me in the mail.  I guess I think it would be less of a hassle to actually lower the prices of the entire store "I generally like browsing at BB&B... but the only downside to this store is the fact that they have so much merchandise crammed into it that it can be a little messy and cluttered... especially around the holidays.  But the employees are pretty friendly and will help you if you are looking for something in particular.  I have been in a couple of times without my coupon  small furniture.... a little bit of everything for home.  I am a fan of Bed Bath & Beyond and this is a great location.  (except for a blonde that works there - she is in a pissy mood EVERY time I am in there Hands down the BEST customer service and return policy! You can return anything you buy there and they give you full credit. It is worth every penny! I love shopping here. You can use the 20% off coupons even when they're expired! Tell me any other store with this customer service and return policy. Impossible! Best hands down! Thanks BB&B! My last great find here was a pair of nice lawn chairs for poolside that were on sale at the end of the summer season." I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here." this summer were rocking crop tops and i found 10 awesome ones i bought. They have a great selection of home decor  chvH1RYr1aNiQScbu35ZCQ STRONG SUGGESTION:  Place your bakery orders in the store and visually review the paperwork to ensure the wording is correct."  I will keep going because there's not another closer. However  but there was also a long line there! I chose to go on a sunday and this may have a lot to do with the troubles that I experienced. The after church crowd is ravenous! All in all they have what is promised... bulk items at a reasonable price. I will continue to shop at this establishment e5xJGurgQboeP5AdX29Bxg If you have a nice white person you should let them walk your goods out for you - they don't even look at the receipt and marker it off and say have a nice day." And most recently after Christmas they had markdowns on a lot of Christmas stuff including toys. An item my son kept asking for when we would go there was this TMNT bus but it was almost $40 and I was not going to pay that. Well after the holidays  which was pretty good. They use a nice whipped cream icing."  the girl who was helping me had a little bit of trouble using the electronic equipment needed to finish the order. It was a tablet not the register which I thought was weird anyways. I had to sign electronically on the tablet and on a paper. Then Think about this carefully before you invest that $45 or $100 in a membership." Made the mistake of forgetting my contacts at home when I drove up here for the weekend. Missy in the optical center was such a life center and was so incredibly helpful! Definitely will be going back. Shopko - I have faith in you! I know you don't suck entirely. I'd even like to give you 3 stars for effort. But when you don't have crayons in August  I always leave disappointed and wondering why I waste my time. The employees here are very rude and purposely avoid having to assist any customers. It is difficult to even find one. The layout of the store makes it difficult to find anything  he says it will probably be about an hour.  An hour?   So at that point 60-90 minutes past my appointment.  I do not think it would have been so bad but he was SO rude.  The amount of attitude I was getting for simply asking a question was not acceptable."  and listen up single dudes--Target seems to be crawling with ladies of the female variety.  Perhaps true love is around the corner from the Bounty paper towels..."  but it's got pretty much everything you need short of a butcher shop and babysitters. Staff is very helpful... it also houses the closest Starbucks to my home. Since we're talking about 2 miles It's Target.....get your shop on! One downside is that they usually could use a few more cashiers up front when things are busy. I've often had to wait a bit longer than seems reasonable to pay for a purchase."  could you be any more motivated? He relented and returned with negative results. Bet he looked real hard. Come on. Any you wonder why American brick and mortar commerce is failing. We are shopping on Amazon tonight."  they called the nearby Sun Prairie location and arranged it so that our order was waiting at that store when we arrived to purchase it. Very satisfied!" I'm having my friend Betsy over for brunch Saturday and I'm going flatten leaves and put them in these frames with our afternoon menu that I'm going to write out in cinnamon stick!" 5FlmcwCLqFveKQ-GVeolig This target is conveniently located on the East side of Madison behind the mall. I have always had good experiences there from helpful and friendly support of their staff to regularly stocked shelves with whatever it is I need that day. I like that they have a grocery area in case I need a couple things instead of going to the grocery store. It is very clean and they have just about anything you need. Pretty good prices as well. 5FlmcwCLqFveKQ-GVeolig The potpourri of intolerables beckons a new chapter in the Fear and Loathing series ..." Prior reviews are harsh to say the least. The store suits a certain demographics. It is fine for them- not every store has to look like Aberchrombie and Fitch does it? I was just there as we walked through to get to Anne Taylor. Sorry no smell evident at all.  They had a broad and amazing variety of winter boots. It was fine.  and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store I want other women to hear my story and be sure to check dressing rooms for locks. I also want people to hear about the complete lack of compassion  empathy I received from the store manager who represents this this company."  a reasonably large selection for the size of the store and when they have sales the sales are super! My favorite section is the clearance room for shoes - always a great place to find a steal on footwear. And I've never had anything but a polite salesperson here and I've been shopping here since the mid 80s." I left wondering what kind of 1980s throwback time machine this place must be. Unorganized  and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space" "Rachel at the Clinique counter is awesome! She has a great memory for what I've previously gotten and what I might like On my latest experience I went for silver jeans and though their signs were wrong they refused to honor the sale price directly above the silver jeans. Doubt I'll be back."  finally I receive my glasses no less than 30 days from the date of order.  That was frustrating  I've been shopping more at Penney's that I had in probably the 5 years before I left. This location and the West Towne location are really making great strides."  and have them sent to the Penney's of your choice. If you get more than $25 of merchandise they ship to the store for free. You waltz in to any register and give them your info (you need your phone number and the credit card you used This is probably the best JCPenney in Madison. Great help from Tracy and Heather tonight from jewelry department. they have a lot of great products! A spacious store with a nice variety of things. Particularly good housewares and shoe sections. Love Marshall. I go there every week to find good things. I am afraid they might start charging me rent. LOL  within about a minute the line grew to be about six people. The second cashier still did nothing. It took her another few minutes to consider jumping on a register to help. My single return and possible shopping trip turned into only a return that took 15 minutes." It's the most sparsely stocked Marshalls I've ever been to but you will find any essentials you're looking for and then some. It's very clean and the staff is incredibly friendly!  other times nothing. When you see something you like grab it since it probably won't be around later. This review isn't about that. It's about the friendly sales staff. I was surprised they were so willing to help my complicated butt out. I wanted a dress displayed on a mannequin and quickly received exceptional service getting my new dress down. They lady who works the dressing room is so nice and happy too. I wish I knew their names so I could give credit : "  but nothing bad either. Lots of homegoods of the mid- to up-market variety and gobs of kitchen gadgets."  but they do have a lot of stuff you just can't find anywhere else around Madison.  And He makes me feel like my business matters. As long as they have Stephan and people like him After I bought the suit I went to Macy's. They had a huge selection and all the swimming suits were in order and the racks were very neat. There were not any kids running amuck nor were there any men in the dressing rooms. From now on I will be going to Macy's first!!!!" See Rachel's review several months after mine. Wadya know. She also has experienced the fine service of local proleteriat women. Hey rachel I'm a good little consumer and I also have been in the service industry for over 13 years.  I have no lofty expectations for my store clerk nor am I a demanding customer.  If anything  shopping at Bergners thinking you will get 50% off $100.00 purchase.  I spent 2 hours looking for anything worthwhile that the coupon would apply to and it's impossible!!!!!" "I shop here most of the time I go to the mall since it is one of the anchor stores. I find at least something to buy there most of the time. It can be very tough to use their big coupons....so many things are ineligible!  But that also means that they have alot of things on clearance and listed as incredible value or best buy. However Sign up for the email club for special coupon savings" Slightly target older people. Have some sophisticated brands like calvin klein or columbus. But even with their yellowdot sales all the time. still pretty pricy  I'm sure you'd find lots of awesome things. It's sort of like a treasure hunt where you are always guaranteed something good! And what's awesome is there seems to be a larger selection for the smaller sizes. . .which is obviously good for me :P"  you're bound to find something cute eventually.  This T.J. Maxx doesn't seem to carry as many high-end brands as others I've been to  it's usually pretty awesome. This is a pretty great spot to spent a rainy afternoon if you've got the time!"  how much was devoted to home. The men's department is SORELY lacking. Need more higher end items. Hard to find the departments you needed- they could improve layout and signage. Never did see the men's shoe department. Good selection of activewear for women. Improvements needed in the top department- I was looking for more casual items. A better selection of toys than some other stores. A better selection of books that other stores." Very good price for some designer brand. Esp like their underwear section Search high and low for red and yellow tag items" Great place! Usually it's picked over by the college students so it's not the best location but overall you can usually get a good deal if you're lucky. I love to go on Thursdays which is when their new truck stop has come through so you're likely to get some great deals!! Great prices!! Love it!  You have to sift through a lot of stuff but it is worth the money you save! Check your receipt for a 20% off coupon after survey on one item"  I'm 5'4"" and most jeans are insanely long on me but the ones I found are perfect! Love the store! They could so without a few rude employees. There's an older woman that works the front she always has such a negative attitude. But still I'll give this store 5 stars" I will come here for discounted perfume. some fun lingerie and guy clothes. They have some fun home decor too.  stop by Marshall's before heading to Dillard's or Nordstrom for the real deal."  it's worth it.  But basically I purchase house stuff and crap I don't need and then I go home and look at it all and wonder why I just spent all this money of ""stuff""-- but I get the shopping rush at a bargain price. What more can you ask for?" 5 stars for the Store Manager Dave who apparently shares a different view of what being a manager means. Thanks to him This store is in a good location on Camelback near where it intersects with N 16th Street." Happy Shopping my friends!"  me and a friend of mine went late one night to shop and I ended up finding great deals.  So I spent about $50 that night.  I walked out and my friend asked what did I get.  Well I didn't have everything in the bags so I went back inside to get it from the cashier.  The first cashier or maybe she was a manager saw me and I told her I just walked out and noticed that I was missing items.  She basically accused me of not telling the truth "This is beginning to become one of my spots in the Valley to shop. I can always count on finding a good deal on brand name items at this location. The stock is always on point...and they really have some cute ""inspired "" pieces too. This location seems to have a better selection "A great place to find deals on good clothes. This location is not as organized - or clean - as some others  which is rare. They always have at least SOMEthing we can't live without. The kitchen section is fun. The housewares is nice. I love discount shopping  but if you're looking for a store that is well organized... this is not the Marshalls you are looking for."  you'll be a fan of this location." "I've never been very impressed with this store.  The clothing selection is ok but not great. The customer service definitely leaves much to be desired. I don't think I've ever had any ask to help me or smile when assisting.  Despite all this I still enjoy looking here from time to time because they do have awesome deals on everything from designer label clothes Not only was he rude to me but also to the woman that was trying to help me do my return. Will never shop at this location or let anyone I care about give there money to this shitty store." Well if you don't really like Last Chance and are looking for a store around this area you should going to Marshalls."  Ralph Lauren anything carries a premium in pricing here."  but 95% of the employees (particularly the ones at the register) are some of the most unenthusiastic and unpleasant workers I've ever come across. Comparable to the DMV."  just watch out all those deals can sneak up on ya!" I didn't really see too much of a selection in comparison to Ross. The housewares selection at Marshall's is pretty nice so it does have that going for it. I would rather come here than have to elbow people left and right at Last Chance just to get a pair of last season's designer boots.  and I am getting the bag so I go browse the jean section.  When I'm ready to check out I walk up to the counter and I see that same man standing there arguing with six of the store associates about my Kate Spade bag.  I walk up to the girl and say ""what is going on""? She replies with ""well this man said that he got an associate to unlock the bag for him first"". So now I'm getting very frustrated I proceed to tell them that I have not only have this bag on hold for two days but since they didn't keep it on hold this is completely their fault that two different customers are arguing over the same handbag.  I back off a little bit once he starts to raise his voice at the associates and continue to argue with them.  I thought to myself OK I will just stand here and be the polite person and not argue.  Well about 15 minutes later I see the fat blonde woman manager waddle up to the front and declare that the rude man deserves the handbag and proceeds to check him out.  You can only imagine the rage I had at this point.  When I went to go ask the young girl with glasses what had happened the blonde manager stepped in and said ""oh (what ever the girls name was) couldn't find you so we just sold it to him  Marshall's will get my business on occasion. As long as they carry Ralph Lauren."  and I am getting the bag so I go browse the jean section.

The store itself is ok in terms of inventory. The clothing section is my least favorite because it does not offer much (as much as I've seen in other locations). The home department is pretty good but that's about it. I have never found shoes I like in this location either. Not sure if all the good stuff is taken by the time I get there or their inventory is just lacking. I never wait in a long line and customer service is ok.  but they get some very awesome things in this store... just scored some gorgeous Tahari Home brass and marble lamps... um gorgeous...." In any event like I said if you want cheap stuff and can deal with the tumbleweeds and dust balls blowing across the isle the venomous packs of cockroach rats and non English speaking staff then Big Lots is for you. On another note this is the best place to by cheap disposable holiday goods i.e. Halloween Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen  but now that I know what they have to offer  that seemed reasonably priced. I never thought of Big Lots for patio furniture... So I shop around looking for discounted prices on items I usually buy elsewhere and am always happily surprised at what I find. Yup- I'll be back." "Big Lots is a Big Lots is a Big Lots.  Not sure why everyone was so disgusted by it  when you go here you end up buying things that you don't even want/need because you are certain that everything you buy is a deal." "I truly appreciate what this store has to offer customers. The staff is friendly and helpful and the store carries almost every item you could think of without looking ridiculous. The prices on most items are insanely low "It works.  I found some picture frames at a cheap price.  Yes they were dusty Terible costumer service from the manager! I found a set of pots and pans that clearly said it was on sale but the guy was a total jerk and refused to give me the discount.  but I'm able to get what I need with ease." Hive fives and thumbs up for this location of Ross"  it looked like their women's section was a lot better stocked than the men's.  I did take note that they had about a thousand bra's.  Just FYI ladies - get your brassieres at Ross!" points off for a shoe section that was the only chaotic mess in the store.  and can someone explain to my bigfoot ass why there's a whole section marked ""11-13"" and it contains almost all 10s and 3 pairs of 11s  organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals."  the shoppers are rude and let their kids run all over the store.  Some of the staff seem a little nicer than they used to be.  If I could find some good deals I might keep going back  kids yelling everywhere.I think this is good Ross to just go in and walk out quickly because ive been to better places."  because you never know what they just got. Give me a call if you see the Chef Basket."  and no waiting in line!!! There were not many people here at all...only reason I didn't dish out the five stars is because the cashier had MAJOR attitude  you will be rewarded with cheap goodies." yLJeaZrH826Udsh_G8ZP2w "Ross is a hit or miss store. Sometimes there are great deals on great items and other times everything is messy and the items they have are poorly made. I like to come here for bedding  are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store ""ghetto."" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area) "Great location in between the target and frys grocery store so whatever you can't find here you can find next door hopefully. Can't comment on the clothes yLJeaZrH826Udsh_G8ZP2w Store is really unorganized. They didn't have much because every time I went to go look through my sizes they weren't in the right places. And when I tried to get help she told me just look through everything. Whaaat why do I need to look through everything when it's their job to have stuff in the right places. I just left lol. A lot of clothes were on ground also Never coming back!  vitamins and a new plant for the office.  After all - it is still a Target."  and at the time didn't have it adjusted to fit me correctly. So I walk into this Target today and ask the women at the jewelry counter if she could help me adjust the band. She informs me that ""they have taken away all their tools"" and ""they don't perform that service anymore"". Way to go Target..."  this Target would be... well... not so ghetto. This one is actually worse than the one at Christown (oh  come to find out it's actually a requirement that stores in phoenix have.  Most stores in the area including Fry's and Wal-Mart have at least one at all times." And I really mean it about the Pharmacy  I really don't have time to stand here and wait for someone to come up here. And continue to make my way to my car myself. While the two of them stand there... presumably." 10) Sure beats going to the ghetto Walmart down the street!!"  they are in the process of remodeling. So in March it will be just as fancy as the others. It has a Starbucks for all those folks that need that. You can eve use your Target card there.(Starbucks) It is always clean  one has to weed through the beggars and unattended shopping carts to get to and from the store.... but that's a whole other review."  especially since they added fresh vegetables  so I still go back. Often. Maybe I'll  get a t-shirt that reads ""I survived Ghetto Target""." This place recently got a facelift!  They added a whole new grocery section and redid the cosmetic area and other parts of the store.  It looks nice now...I have been to nicer Target's but this one is so close and convenient to my house.  It is very easy to get to and the parking lot is large and never too crazy...except for holidays.  I always find everything I need...I love ELF cosmetics and they have plenty of that...the clothing options are decent I have seen more at other Targets but its still good!  I really like their Starbucks in this store.  They always get my drink just right and they always have the cups I want if the Starbucks across the street is sold out.  They have decent prices on groceries and I love the Up and up brand!  I find just as good of deals at Target as I do at Walmart!  I have gotten alot of home decor items here and they always have a great selection.  They have a way better selection here then at the Target in the Pavilions in Scottsdale.  The staff has always been helpful and nice.  It is a great Target! with a Starbucks and a little food court. Every other dept is full of exactly what you came for. I even only buy dog food here. They have the best price for  the good stuff.   Lots of parking in the lot as well. Long hours they open @8:30 am & close @9:30 pm.                   Can't believe Christoper had a bad review for this Target.                          The cashiers and other people that work there are fantastic. Very Helpful." "Once again i must sing the praises of  Target. They are so great and friendly in this store. I absolutely love the Pharmacy! They have the absolute best people working here.                             I do not even live any where near this Target.                                         But  and now they of course carry food..... Seems as if all the Targets are starting to carry food.  They have really good fruit and vegtables....so it is almost like one stop shopping.  The stafff at the Pharamcy is really good always happy and always helpful. There is so much you can get here. Lots of parking in the lot.  They have really great hours as well."  that my friends just bought star #5! That extra hour is seriously invaluable seeing as I often get off at 10pm and need to buy groceries and other essentials after work. Add in how incredible the location is with Costco and Fry's in the same lot and I'd give it six stars if I could. Love the Arcadia Target along with the whole shopping corner it's in!"  and the other is Nicole in the Pharmacy dept she has the best customer service" You're like the geyser Old Faithful without the danger of annoying steam burns."  such customer service is the stuff of management-- I truly hope that this guy gets the attention and promotion he deserves. It is very hard to find service like that in retail and what this store has in this man is a real gem. Thank you for making my stressful day a lot more pleasant!"  i have had the good luck to always been nice and kind to me  Target will always have my heart."  or largest target around but you'll still find what you're looking for. Much better service and faster checkout than at Walmart down the road." I got a medium just in case. So I would go to a different target and get a smaller size. Fingers crossed." This Target is nice. They have a grocery section and offer great deals on everything. Super easy to find what you are looking for and the staff was very friendly. It's the place I quick run to when I need something. I MUCH rather go here than Fry's or Walmart. Target is better than Walmart."  I will probably return anyway.  Just be wary of the sale signs - they mean nothing." The Bad:  Products here don't always show the correct prices &/or sale prices.  I don't recommend the pharmacy (Extremely! expensive).   The Good:  Items here are mostly low-cost & has food & clothes.  they will correct it!  It's crazy I know!  Thank you target!"  nothing special about this one.  Only good thing is that this location is close to my work place so if I need anything for my job VxnV1uMZURUQMNUaPdB8QA This particular store is layed out similarly like other Targets Why would you put products out on display that you can't sell? I was going to spend $300 just like that...but this Target doesn't need the additional revenue apparently." "What happened to Target's product quality?  I have never bought so much junk that breaks or is not of quality value.  It used to be a good store.  I just bought the Bissell SpotBot  and the checkout aisles are ran very efficiently. David appears to be one of the shift supervisors  and the staff is very nice and helpful. I do a lot of shopping here based on the cleanliness and atmosphere. I would recommend this target to anyone looking for a nice place to shop."  I had a complete crying meltdown while waiting for my husband to come rescue us. I honestly do not understand the good reviews for this place. Never again." Wish I could give NO STARS I go to Targets in different cities expecting to find something different or new.  Nope.  All Targets are exactly the same.  last year). Didn't learn and didn't look last week. I came home with two expired items. So during today's run we made an effort to look at all expiration dates of items we normally would purchase. Of the 20 items we looked at 5 were at least 30 days expired and three were to expire in 2 days (boxed stuff). That is not OK! Sadly this doesn't seem to be contained to bad management at one store. Shopping trip 1 was at one Target (Tempe Marketplace)  but appreciate that the checkout lines are typically reasonable and cashiers usually friendly."  but appreciate that the checkout lines are typically reasonable and the cashiers are usually friendly." Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review I had to show the ad to multiple people. The sale items is buried in the stock room none are on the sales floor. The other item is on the sales floor but not marketed with the sale price. I have been waiting 20 minutes for a manager to find them.  was so friendly and helpful. He was patient with us and went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. Thank you for a great shopping experience." Great target! Always clean and everyone here is extremely friendly. My go to Target in the Valley.  found some cheap items that I was looking for." Bigger location.  More options.  Everything is still only $1."  and far from the vast marvels of the one at University and Lindsay in Mesa. If you need a Dollar Tree right now  handed me the change and receipt. I stopped coming to this location because the employees are always rude but thought I'd check it out since I hadn't been there in months. NEVER AGAIN"  dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black ""stuff"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them  the dressing room associates are friendly. No one here seems to hate their job Friendly staff compared to other Ross's I have been to. found few good items. place was not to unorganized.  because I purchased the item more than 30 days ago they refused to issue me a credit to my Visa.  I was given a store credit.  My fiance tried to return a defective bottle of cologne this past weekend (the pump spray stopped working) and they would not exchange the defective item for a working item. We will be taking all of our business away from Ross and shopping at other discounters like Target I'll definitely head back to this location for more." "I just got off work and I decided I was going to swing by Ross to pick up some bras. I came in found what I needed and went to pay for it. The cashier was trying to be friendly and ask how my day was. I said I just got off work he then he says and I quote ""why you are bra shopping at this time of night Downside: You can't take the cart out of the store which makes it a bit difficult to buy several big items. The cashier was a bit confused on how to package my 6 big curtain rods. I mentioned about them helping me out in which they were non-responsive. How did I get my items out? 3 trips out to the car which wasn't a big deal. Also the loss prevention guy kept staring at me which was awkward." "Always kinda half empty store... The one at Desert Ridge is a bit better and cleaner  I mostly find everything needed. Great stores nearby. Dark parking lot isn't good." "Went here to some good socks and man this store was bad. Very dirty and why the staff  would complain about a grown man and woman playing with a huge beach ball and playing tea party on a patio set and do NOTHING about it (like maybe asking then to leave the store?) They made the trip even worse! They were loud and obnoxious to all other shoppers. (Advice to the Loss Prevention Guy: You are there for a reason  the selection is terrible and the store is dirty. Its convenient to my house but its worth the drive to the Desert Ridge location. This location would be better served with more management and a better selection of products."  but don't necessarily need lol. Their household area has a large selection. I rarely leave empty handed."  same as any other Big Lots.  They all seem pretty consistent.  Bit of a ""desperation & despair"" feeling in there from the employees and clientele Cheap.. Hit or miss but cmon.. It's that kind of store . Always have the dog bagels that my pup has to have.. People are friendly.. I have never been to this location before. I used to go to the 1 on 67th ave & Cactus because it was in the same complex as my hubby's office & I would have to pick him up sometimes. I went there so much I would buy shit I didn't need so I stopped that habbit & haven't been to 1 for like 3 years or so. Well this trip was not a cheap 1 like I had hoped. We saw tons of cool lights & decorations for the house & ended up spending $130 all on Christmas stuff! I don't think I would have come here just to shop randomly though  but this one was a pleasant surprise.  I will drive out of my way to go to this store.  I hope they keep it nice.  I never know when I may need some fabuloso or some other random stuff." "Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots  now that's what i'm talking about. I've been to the stores in Tempe and Scottsdale. I prefer the Scottsdale location because it seems to have more variety  and tacky decor galore. Plus one time my roommate bought a whole box of beer shampoo. Sadly there was no matching beer conditioner. We also used to do something called Adventure Snacking where we'd go to Big Lots or the local dollar store and buy the weirdest edible things we could find. We're still alive  but not a bad stop off if you are in the area already!" 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH" Love this Big Lot store. Have been to many others and this one is staffed with friendly people and have a great selection. Good job guys! Been shopping here for years. Weird they switched location space. It's good still. Excellent service and some workers have been there for years. Thanks for the service. Stocking was great. Not rushed towards end of working hours. Thanks. 000 and more. Don't let these furniture places try and tell you how great their stuff is and why they are justified charging three times as much. If you pay attention to what you're buying Been shopping here for years. Weird they switched location space. It's good still. Excellent device and some riders have been there for years. Thanks for the service. Stocking was great. Not rushed towards end of working hours. Thanks. They usually send 20% off coupons in the mail and through the Sunday ads of the AZ Repub. Will come in handy with those prices!" Love their glassware like Ridel & Elisch & Mikasa stemware."  the lady that helped me out spent about 10 minutes looking online to help me find someone locally that might have it.    Thank you and well done folks!"  towels etc...they only had the curtain and the trash can but they ordered the rest for me- no charge for shipping and I even got 20% off! YAY!" use you coupons! they never expire! "...they only offer 20% off because their prices are marked up 25% from nearly everywhere else.  Shop the clearance to get some deals On my last visit to B B & B I noticed a section of the store that usually sold artwork and garden decorations has now morphed into a small drug store dubbed the ""beauty and wellness section"" offering toothpaste and other toiletries I am not familiar with seeing at this store.. While I have never purchased bedding from here (I think some items are marked up to allow for the 20% off coupon) my two bathrooms are elegantly decorated thanks to Bed Bath & Beyond." "Well I learned something very interesting today that may cause me to frequent this locale more often in the future. The 20% coupons that we are ALWAYS receiving in the mail......DON'T EVER EXPIRE. The manager was talking to a customer today and she informed her that while the coupons do have expiration dates on them.....DO NOT THROW THEM AWAY. You can also use multiple coupons as well for the same item.....which can add up to some pretty good savings especially for BIG TICKET items. I don't think you will save much on other items in the store because they do mark things up pretty good....so even with the discount savings you would probably come out better at another department store. The store is very large.....great selection....awesome staff.....and has outstanding customer service. The store is very neat.....clean....well lit.....and organized. Eat rhxBsu0k_BddgjOP9MYdeA  it's Bed Bath and Beyond! And "This Bed Bath and Beyond keeps getting better they already had a personal care and beauty section; now they added a World Market food section. This new food section is bigger than the food section in a regular World Market store I have to say that I am totally amped that this bed bath and beyond has a world market in it. I asked the girl at the front if it was actually THE world market inside and she said that it was the only one in the state and probably would be the only one. So I basically went here to return a toaster that I bought back in August that just crapped out on me.  So I returned it picked out another one and that was that no questions asked. "The associates at this location are ANAZING! Went in there looking to replace my boss' French Press with the exact brand and type. But I couldn't find the size I needed All the other employees were very helpful."  she was nothing but snarky and rude. Almost is if my time was not of importance to her. Then proceeded to walk away in the MIDDLE of me talking to her before I could finish my sentence... Then for the second mishap with the employees at that location Just stopped in to pick up a Christmas gift. I had a store credit that was really old and was having some issues but the store manager Michaella was AMAZING and helped me get everything taken care of. The holidays can be stressful so I am very grateful for her kindness and helpfulness! I only chatted with a couple of other store employees but they were all very nice and efficient. 5 stars!!! "I tried to purchase patio furniture covers using a gift card over the phone.  After the sales rep. took my details and completed the transactions she informed me that it did not go through and that I could not use my gift card over the phone.  I called the credit card company and found that BB&B had taken the funds out. I called back the store and they had no record of the transactions.  So basically  Big Lots is like a sport.  The competition is how good a deal you can get.  If you're willing to take a sticky bottle They carried out the furniture and loaded it up and to top it all off we had a 20% off coupon for the whole order so cheap became damn cheap... sweet!"  and the have a furniture section to boot. Sign up for their email list and get the inside scoop on special deals and promotions." Give it a try! You may be surprised and your wallet will sure thank you!" Great customer service.  Great location." "I was really surprised at how much good stuff they had at Christmas. I was looking for gigantic bows and I found them there and more! The gal that stocks the place really takes pride to make sure everything is where it should be and knows it like the back of her hand. You ask "I love Big Lots! They have some great deals on food. We have a toddler and we get fruit pouches for a fraction of the cost here. Most of the products are not the best quality  did I mention that the stuff is cheap? There really shouldn't be any reason to lower the stars for a Big Lots being a Big Lots. I hate a lot of things  and it is in dire need of a remodel but you can tell they try. The staff is pleasant and the selection is good."  but the employees are very helpful and typically have great attitudes. There is always too much conditioner and too little shampoo "I refuse to shop at any other dept store they have extra 30% off sale merch every once in awhile so those reg priced $400 boots on sale at 25% off are now just $210 I used that nifty calculator feature on this pc :) This location is always getting better clothing lines I love that they actually have a large ""Missy"" section so that I can dress my actual age and not like a Junior or Grandmother. No other store has sales like them even those Ross (Eww) Marshalls It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey  but great sale going on on the clearance racks - 70% off original prices. DNKY "I am a big fan of Dillard's and its great sale.  Twice a year they put most shoes at 65% off.  It used to be 75% a few years back.  Good all days.  You can find amazing shoes at a bargain.  I got a pair of Coach wedges I've been using like crazy lately.    The dress section is also really nice.  I found a few great dresses for party season.  And the purses  friendly service people.  Not the most upscale of stores at this blockbuster mall  and some Philosophy products as well. This new addition is a big plus as I am always going between Ulta (which is across the street) and here for MAC products. Now I have the brands that I love all in one department store! Go Dillards! The children's and men's departments are rather large and of course they have a junior's and women's section." Super happy with the selection "I shop here often the selection can be some what lacking in the men's department. Beyond that this particular location continues to amazes me with there inability to remove security tags. I've been forced to drive back to the store twice in as many visits to have the security tags removed. PLUS the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing. After this last trip I'm returning everything I purchased I highly recommend this location." "Well I have to tell you I have always had issues with Dillard's customer service.....and that has not changed with this location. I do have to say that at the very least the cashier's are somewhat pleasant but trying to find any assistance here.....FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! So why 4 stars do you ask? Well the deals they have during the holiday season are tremendous....not to mention the quality of the clothing I purchase is fantastic. I am ALWAYS looking for a good deal and high quality products.....and since I can find both here that warrants 4 stars since it is a department store. If they can do this all year around and improve the customer service I can easily give them 5 Stars. Eat "Don't count on them to open on time. Doors are locked and people wait out side for them to open after they are already suppose to be open. If you are trying to get into the mall through them then those doors are locked even longer. When I asked for them to open them I got the look of ""that's not my job""."  I moved to another department and received exceptional service from a saleswoman whose name has escaped me.  She spent several minutes helping me select the perfect gift.  She then escorted me to another department where I was assisted by yet another helpful and patient employee.  I've received this type of service at high-end stores  rude.   I wish more of the employees that work with the public did it with kindness and a smile.  I won't be spending my money at Dillard's any more.   I just don't enjoy the experience." You will not regret the new years sale we have been doing this for 4 years now." You have the poorest selection od dress shoes for 120.00! Give me a break we bought the same thing at focus for 45.00! And they were NICE! NEVER COMMING BACK!  couldn't even look me in the face . I had to go upstairs to customer service to have them do it and even they were confused how to return the cash I paid and the rest back on my card . I'm sure I'm not the only person to have ever paid 1/2 cash and 1/2 credit . Not rocket science . So what should have been a simple return took an hour of my time ." Much thanks to the great customer service here." I purchased some shoes at fashion square and didn't realize they gave me the wrong size. I came in and Carter was able to find the right pair in the right size and was super professional about it. I was in and out within ten minutes. The employees in the handbags department ALWAYS hover. I understand why they do it...but wow. It's extremely frustrating.  Sue came along and said they do not do anything with repairs.  I would be on my own for that. So then I thought maybe I should just return it. There is wifi in the store but I couldn't get to my electronic receipt. I assumed they would have the sale in the register like a normal store. Nope if I didn't purchase it within three days the information is gone and there is nothing they can do to help. Sue was nice enough but the rule are the rules. I really felt like it was some ""old school"" rules. I can't even imagine doing business with such archaic constraints. It was an impulse buy so I guess I learned a lesson. I won't be back."
