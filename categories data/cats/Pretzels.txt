"Wetzels's Pretzels is definitely amazing and very crave-able. I am pretty boring when it comes to pretzels... I like them plain with salt. No dipping sauce or weird pizza flavors for me. Wetzel's offers delicious plain pretzels and bite size wetzel bits as well which are perfect for sharing! Also if all that salt leaves you feeling thirsty try their frozen lemonades. They have regular and cherry  and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top tU8wF7wVPct7i_tM31dGgw Very bad customer service! Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter. She is the wetzel pretzel devil! the jalapeno cheese dog is the bomb!!!
