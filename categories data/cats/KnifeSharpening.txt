 the knife had a single angle to the blade from front to back. Now the angle visually appears to vary as well as the depth of the cutting edge Excellent service. My knives were done super fast and they were amazingly sharpened. The service was spectacular and I highly recommend them!  I appreciate the extra step he took to educate me on the sharpening and what to do to keep the edge.  He also gave my knife compliments saying it was a high quality handmade knife. Good to know my buddy is putting out a great product." Arizona Cutlery was in a good location for me Service was fast and more than reasonable at $3.00..." This is the ONLY place I go to get my knives sharpened. Excellent job! Enuf said! I had 6 knives done for $15.
