Drinks are stiff and relatively cheap.  There's usually always a free table to sit at and the clientele is varied and friendly.  Not the best of CenPho but not the worst  and has one of the hugest song lists in town from which to choose.  They have also recently added a 1960s British mod dance night on Wednesdays." This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy  but otherwise it's definitely worth a try." They occassionally host cool events or concerts here and I highly recommend dropping in on days like those  its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours  they really need to shell out the dough for that." The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far.  but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection I'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically  is actually from Britain and mingles with the customers as if he was welcoming him into his own home. Be sure to check out the jukebox - it's one of the best I've seen!" 4 stars - based on a first experience. I say that's pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back. (NOTE: I went back...the next night! And I had just as great - if not a better - time at G&D. Bonus! I heard real British accents!)"  I think we've covered it all. Now just wait 'til that blasted construction is finished..." Veggie pasty. Old Peculiar. HP Sauce. A side of darts. Try and get those things together anywhere else in Phoenix. I dare you. 'Nuff said. Don't forget to try the fried pickles!"  darts and good beer.  The food is typical bar food with an English flavor to it.  The crowd is always a mix  but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing  one of the best places to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks." Want a great place to catch up with some out-of-town friends without being annoyed?  Go to George & Dragon!  Great vibe  another restaurant (there may even be two or three) in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area  the G&D is for you.  The best English Pub in the valley in my mind."  shepherd's pie and of course sherry trifle dessert. Cool place to play darts and socialize and mingle. The staff is friendly and atmosphere great. Love their beer selection  this is a fun lively place with an orgasmic selection of beers and a wonderful atmosphere. It will NEVER be London  ""G&D"" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink." If you can get past the creepers that haven't been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies." "We ended up there on Saturday night after a fabulous dinner and some pre drinking. We were met with friendly faces and an awesome waitress. She was the type of waitress that could anticipate what you would want to drink and never kept us waiting. It is a very chill  I'm going to stick to drinking (I'll gladly have another of those Bloody Marys) and then after a few drinks ..and thus continues our quest for a great fish and chips meal served in a great setting.  Any reco's?  We've been to McCormick and Schmick's and Rula Bula; both weren't good enough for her.  Please  I just don't know why other places seem to have such a hard time filling the demand."  great selection and really reasonable prices. I'll be back."  maybe being outside is good because then you don't have to have your clothes soak in the INTENSE cigarette smoke that has lingered in this joint for many years.  Oh  and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley." 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg Maybe I will come back with ""What Odor?"" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning."  as well.  Good place for a pint of your favorite English ale or stout." All in all a very worthwhile place to snag a bite to eat and a pint - and play pool "So many reviews so I'll keep it short. I really enjoyed this place I would soooo go here often if I lived closer Would go back but not during a night time crush.  Maybe when MLS season starts up."  losing 2 whole stars for degraded service?  I went in again recently after about a year hiatus and I was unfortunately reminded.  Go for the drinks  but who eats at a place like this anyway? It's a funbar!"  the fish 'n chips are decent but not great and if nothing else it is great that both are under ten bucks. Drinks are decently priced and they have real gingerale. (mhhh wiskey ginger) The owner either used to do tons of coke or still does because he is always frenetically bouncing around the bar talking a mile a minute to his regulars. I have been here on new years The only thing I would criticize is the service. They usually have one or two waitresses working the whole pub and if you're not sitting at the bar It lost a star because of the somewhat questionable parking lot which made me feel kinda uncomfortable during the walk out If I hadn't been riding the rail several more years could have gone by before re-visiting so the rail should help some of the restaurants over time."  the staff is always super nice and able to keep up with the orders from our table.  Just before the countdown begins the staff passes out champagne and party favors to everyone in the bar!  We've never had a bad experience here and plan to continue our tradition for years to come!!" This pub is a great place to hang out with old friends or make new ones."  they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy  big booths and the eclectic group of patrons.  Some still seem like they are stuck in the 80's listing to their metal bands but hey that is why I like living downtown because you see all types which is cool."  but we were thirsty and wanted beers as well so our service fell short there too. I was told that a good time to go is in the evening and not to sit at the bar. I'll try that if I ever visit G&D again." Good french dip. Great bloody mary.  pleasant but kinda slow .For the food  2.5  rounded down to 2 because It's really not OK  to have two main dishes fall so far short of pub food."  I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on." And this place reeks of British wanna-bes and malt vinegar.  I think I even saw the reflection of the Queen Vic in the pool or urine out back!" *** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work Had to bump G&D up to an A-ok status. My advice: Don't sit at the bar. Get a table where a cool waitress will help you even when it's crazy busy! Bumped up one star due to better service!  although I haven't made much of a dent in my card because I never go.  Supposedly they have quiz night on Thursdays which might cause me to up my star rating..." I always like the shepards pie but there are lots of tasty things about and some of them are hard to find outside of Britain. (Try the scotch egg if you feel adventurous)."  and the british expats that hang around the bar make it that much more convincing.  I'm confident that the incident we had with service was just that ""an incident"" and it's possible the waitress was just spread thin or stressed.  I'm confident our next visit will be fine  and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central." 3.5 rounded down to 3.  Hey that's one better than prior."  but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K."  we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless Go when there are good sports on for the rowdy atmosphere  decent service. Nothing stands out just ok. The owner is a goof ball and trys to hit on every women in the place."  our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately [[Eaaawwwwwe Eaaawwwwwe]]" air conditioned. I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't good. I liked the atmosphere other than the bathroom.. I could drink here but wont eat here again." I love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!"  but after he leered at me and made lewd comments about my boobs..I don't know.  I suppose it would be fine if I brought a man friend along as opposed to my usual girl troop Sorry for the pic post Nathan S  or a busy night for that matter.  I guess unless you are a regular the bartenders don't pay much attention to the rest of the customers.  Location sucks unless you are at an event at Steele Indian School Park or maybe doing a light rail pub crawl.  Too far away from Downtown and not close enough to Camelback(Midtown).  Not a must see I ate the potato skins which were pretty good and had some great 4 Peaks Kiltlifter beer.  Cheap tab and a USA win good way to spend a Saturday night." I love pubs in general and would definitely go back any time."  not for the atmosphere." The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk."  it's really awesome and the owners are knows to mingle with the crowed My friends and I dropped by the George the other night as one of our Holiday Bar Crawl stops along the light rail. They had a live band playing Totally come here. Me and my friends will probably be there too."  just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded please tear this place down. "I've only been here once and it was OK. If you're into the English pub scene  and the beer is cheap. I would recommend that people should check this place out and if you do you won't be disappointed." "I love the Pub! I don't get there very often any more but I wish I could! Trivia Night (Thursdays) is a blast! They have a Great Beer Selection "This is my kinda place.   Nice casual place with good food and good beer.  Not to mention it is walking distance from the Central/Indian School lightrail station.  I stopped in here on a whim while spending a Saturday on the lightrail ( I made good use of my day pass).  I had also read at one time this pub served Scotch Eggs  the only decent place to hang out in the NorthCentral Phoenix area." There's 1 bathroom for girls. No stalls. If someone's in there you'll have to wait your turn. At least it wasn't filthy & smelly."  all the decor...cause it's never been cleaned/dusted since 1995."  you'll probably have a good time here.  The food's not frou-frou and ""foodie"" - it's just good.  My favorite bar in Phoenix - no place I'd rather get pissed."  nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the ""cool"" part." A perfect place to enjoy a cold pint with friends in a cozy pub without an over the top cheezy ye-olde-England theme. I love the fact that they serve *several* different types of hard cider and $3.00 Jgerbombs all the time. Our waitress was super nice and I'll be back sometime for the food. Thanks for the service on quite a spirited day!"  as many have pointed out and I thought the food was pretty good."  and to me a frosty Kronenbourg. After a few pints were knocked back we hit the billiards at a mere .50 cents a game. Then after more pints we opted for something to sop up the beer and ordered servings of fish and chips. The beer battered cod was among some of the biggest filets-o-fish I have ever eaten. Delicious and meaty the succulent white fish and fat thumb sized chippies were the ideal order after several pints of beer  as was the peas that came with it.  My husband and daughter split the Shepard's Pie and they both loved it.  Great beer as well.  I saw some other customers with the fish and chips and they looked great-I think next time that will be what I get.  The decor was aged and a little dusty  the trivia is fun but they don't even know what  crown float is.  This is an English pub you say?  Pshaw." Great surprise. The steak pie was awesome! Have been to this place twice and the experience was the same. I personally don't get what draws people to this place. It's got a bit of a negative vibe. The staff is not friendly or service oriented and it's dirty. Great location for a light rail pub crawl - I think it just might not be our crowd. Huge wings!  Delish!  Great beer selection. Good environment. If you are reading this you've probably already been there so this is nothing new. A great place to hang out and chill with peeps after work. The fish and chips is kinda pricey but the restaurant gave great portion of the fries and I was able to share with friends. G&D had a great selection of beer and my fave is the Kilt Lifter. Love it! I like the G&D but the staff has been changing for the worse. Last night was the first night I could confirm that the staff there is costing the owner money. If I had no regard for the establishment then I would just stop going there and never take the time to write this review.  I'll be back in a few months to see how things are going..." I'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?"  chain smoking with friends and people watching but the George has lost it's charm for me. My purse was stolen the one and only time I didn't bring it with me to the bathroom. I did leave it with a group of dudes thinking it would be safe but no. I've seen three arrests out front. One time these junkie looking dudes were licking each other's hands in front of the patio until the cops came. I've seen a girl pee her pants INSIDE the bathroom and then proceed to slip on the sidewalk which was wet from the misters nearly cracking her head open. Many  all hail the queen! cheerio."  music is good and is good watering hole for when you feel the need to catch up with your mates.   Just don't look too closely at the carpets...." 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg "Where else would you go to get Corn Beef and Cabbage on St. Patricks Day.  Love it  and fantastic wings (spicy and tart). Plus the kitchen is open late.  This is a great place to spend the evening throwing back beers with good friends!"  good happy hour.  Come for Thursday trivia night if you want to meet people." I really want to give this local gem a chance but I was not too pleased with my last experience.  Some friends and I had planned to attend the Beerfest in Phoenix.  The rain drove us to wait it out at George & Dragon's.  Unfortunately the staff were not prepared for the amount of customers that would hid from the rain that day.  As I could see there was one bartender and one waitress.  We couldn't get a drink or even order food.  After patiently waiting for 20 minutes we left this establishment and headed to another local pub.  I've heard so many great things about this place but this day I left very disappointed. Valerie is a great BTW and one of the most consistent staff."  a good place to start off a night or hang out for a game.  Would not go for more than a happy hr type venture."  but everyone seemed to be having fun. They had tvs playing the basketball game and the place was pretty busy at around 8:30 when we went there. We ordered a couple beers (I got a Hef and he got a black velvet I think.... cider and Guinness) and we ordered a shepherd's pie and some fries. The beers were good and the food was really tasty. It was exactly what I wanted but didn't know I wanted. The shepherd's pie is really mashed potato -y and the meat is really tasty.... very flavorful. The pie is huge too so I wouldn't think twice about sharing it. After that he got a jameson and ginger ale and I got a couple shots- a buttery nipple (the best shot) and an orgasm shot (ok... not as good as the other). The BF's drink was huge... like a pint of whiskey. Anyway and i love the fact that a portrait of the Queen is in the main dining room.                                        The decor is very British. I am not a Drinker however  so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par." My team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!"  and always greet you warmly when you arrive! The food is traditional English pub fare: the fish and chips and the bangers and mash are HIGHLY recommended! I hear the wings are pretty good  but would go back to check that out.  Best part is that they are so close to the lightrail I'll probably go back for the Cornish Pasty and also cause men actually FLIRTED with me there  its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking ""random"" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same ""three"" girls and then the host ""randomly"" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed  it isn't too much more than that. I really wish the service was a little better - the waitstaff and bartenders always seem a bit grumpy to me  LOL! Me? I stuck to Guinness by the pint and had the Cornish pasty and sausage roll - both delectable but kind of small for the $6 price tag. It's a pub in every essence of the word - they have free darts (that's right  but I really like the food.   I took my Dad here for Father's Day lunch and really enjoyed our meal.  The iced tea was fresh and my cornish pastie was really delicious.  I wish I had one now.  My Dad's steak and mushroom pie looked really good too.  Also  and booze but I got to say that the service is hit and miss. There are 2 servers that are polite and most the rest aren't happy to be there. Sometimes there attitude goes hand in hand with the quality of service. I will continue to eat and drink there though the service is hit and miss."  loves the food as it takes him back to his memories of England.  The service is good and the people are always friendly!  The Blackberry and Apple crumble is the best!  Be sure to save room for that dessert!" "Great English pub in the middle of Phoenix.  The fish and chips meal is delicious.  Also  why go to a bar? I have had great luck here. This place is everything that I would expect an English pub to be. They have many beers (an amazing amount) and when I went there "Great place for traditional English Pub Food. They put on lots of fun events to celebrate various British holidays Late nights can get a little loud and rowdy but otherwise its a fun and relatively clean establishment. Cant wait to go again!"  but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg tve9aUdKff_CWW-6fn1T1A  but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one It doesn't matter how I spend my day I am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.  I rarely miss a Trivia night on Thursdays.  Highly recommend hitting up the G&D "The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks Cheap drinks! and it wasn't even happy hour! SCORE! Seriously. I thought this place was a Chinese food place due to the name. I had no idea it was actually a Pub. My mistake. I was here this past Saturday celebrating a friends birthday and we enjoyed ourselves. Between people watching and just talking about everything (and I do mean everything) plus the drinks were cheap. What more can a girl ask for? I will definitely be back here again! Treated very well here every time none the less."  pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows good food d prices but not to hefty om the portions I like it though. Food is good!" We will definitely be making this place a regular stop." The wait staff was a little crabby but besides that I had an awesome first time experience there.  or are friends with the owner. They would be doing a better service to be honest and get him to make the changes necessary to turn the restaurant/bar into a place people want to come back to. If changes aren't made This place is always a good time."  we would have stayed the entire night and finished up the game. A couple of my friends did end up ordering dinner from the menu. I have to say that the fish looked delish! The only downfall to this place is that it does get a little loud during the busy nights and the sound system can be a little better for those who are trying to listen to the trivia questions (on Thursday). Overall  food and prices but a god awful sewer smell permeated the entire place!" Too much good fun.......can't wait for the next one!!!!!" "The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless Still G&D is a great place! .. I will order something different next time."  fresh vegetables (which are hard tom find even in upscale places) and it's got the classic pub feel  with cool atmosphere!" "The fish and chips tasted very good. The problem was that the bar was on the grimey side and the food was not fresh. The corn that came as a side was definitely not fresh I would be willing to wager was frozen. The staff was polite but hard at work trying to obtain good tips from regulars and everyone else was 2nd class. I would return "Would have given it zero stars. The waitress was awful. Completely forgot about us Good Food! PLEASE get some new Tv's Not a good place for NFL Sundays! I've sampled the fish and chips and Shepard's pie and have not been disappointed.  Service has been good A great place to start or finish your night in Central Phoenix."  seems like a few pros show up and put on quite a show.  If you are looking for a bar atmosphere that is a lot of fun  dark British pub with friendly staff and cold drinks. I like the dart boards and pool tables. The patio looking onto Central would be cool if it wasn't always filled with smokers. Don't bother dressing up or expecting to see pretty people here. You go to drink! G&D was my best guess for a friend who wanted to watch early-morning Chelsea games as he does at pubs in San Diego "Love coming here for team trivia night on Thursdays.  They have Guinness on tap  sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is  solid place that is very comfortable and you are guaranteed a good meal.  Good parking  pretty sure it was for St Joe's hospital. The corn beef and cabbage was flavorless deli corn beef. (no seasoning...) The wife had seasonless fish and chips. Better hiring and training will fix all this. So why the 3 stars after all this? Great live music and a well poured Guinness is worth something. ;)" Love this Pub! The Shepherds Pie and bread pudding is AWESOME! Plenty of beer on tap and available. This place has that home town around the corner feel. My only complaint with this bar is that if you are female the waitresses tend to take their time serving you! Otherwise I dig the joint! The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.  But the service was inexcusable." I received a very nice email from the manager addressing our unsatisfactory experience.  I always appreciate when managers/owners care enough to reach out to an unhappy customer.  I will definitely give G&D another shot.  but the food was ""meh.""  For an English pub the fish and chips were average at best. The service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff. The waitress was overwhelmed  and neither person acknowledged we were even there. It would have been a totally different experience had someone at least greeted us and let us know it would just be a minute. Unfortunately  with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food."  that I have ever had in my entire live. It is layered with awesomely goodness. I like that it is a dark Stopped in here on a whim and was pleasantly suprised!  This is a great bar with great food.....try the scottish egg!  The bartender sat and told me about other sites in thePhoenix area that I should go check out!  Very friendly place.  I will be returning !  possibly the best fish and chips I've had in the States."  the food is hit or miss. I have had the fish & chips 2 times and it was good but the coleslaw that came with it was horrible. The other times I had just a pub burger and it was nothing special. I've been able to catch a few of the bagpipe acts here and it's cool to see. They have darts and a pool table. Overall it's a cool place to come have a drink." I love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out Absolutely fun place to hang out. Good beer. Good food...except avoid the coleslaw. They had live music when we were there. I've never been to England or Europe but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Fun people fun atmosphere fun times.  the chips were nice and hot too. The wife had steak and kidney pie which she said was perfect . They have a great selection of beer and liquor . Would absolutely go back again next time we see a Dbacks game."  I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot. Maybe another item on the menu will be better on the palate!" "Basically a no frills pub.  It's been here forever and they're unapologetically unpretentious.  If you're looking for fine dining or exquisite presentation you're in the wrong place.  But if you want some decent pub grub  and friendly staff. We've been coming here for Thursday trivia for a few months now. It's a great place to get together with friends! The crowd is a nice mix and it's definitely not a pretentious place."  and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in Sit in the main part of the restaurant - be ready for a bit of loud music / noise.  Enjoy the decor and eat some good pub food."  and wasn't even cooked long enough to make the breading crisp.  It was just too heavy.  I wish the breading was thinner and crisper.  This is why I rated only a three.  It makes me wonder about the rest of the dishes.  Maybe I'll get another chance to eat here again." Good food. Staff is really nice. Erica she was a little snotty but over all a good place to be. Good vibes for the most part. They have karaoke and pool too. Cool place.  food is excellent every time. What more could you ask for? It feels like home. Home sweet pub."   you can barely tell. The fish was flaky and juicy and the batter was crisp and flavorful. The chips were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside so they were obviously cooked at the perfect temperature.  Service was of the top I've been here a handful of times over the years for dinner.  Had no clue they had a weekend brunch menu.  I think I was the only one that  ordered off the regular menu in our group.  Based on comments no one went away unhappy with their choices.  Our waitress had never worked opening shift before but did a great job.  The place is getting a little worn but it fits.  I am sure I'll end up here again. 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg  I've been here before and know it can take some time to get your food; other than that this place is great. Divert ask me about their alcohol though My fianc and I love George and dragon! We live down the street and ride our bikes there a lot. The owner is very friendly and the bartender is excellent! Try the honey siracha wings they are to die for. Some of the best fish and chips around. The potato skins are a god send after drinking for 3 hours straight. Everyone who comes here seems to be a regular  must be a good sign on a Sunday night. The waiter was very friendly. We  had to try the fish and chips...outstanding. Not greasy and you actually get fish instead of gready batter with a little fish. Drinks were good and strong. The owner was there and came by to greet our table. After ready some previous post on Yelp Great food... Can not even explain the enjoyment from the Greek pizza! So delicious in my mouth! And the Guiness promo! The boyfriend got free glasses! AND for the desert... Berry cobbler... YUM! Just moved from beach area CA... So not biased! Please enjoy this place?  we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville." Avoid this place.  Terrible service.  Enough said." There food is really good! Affordable and great food! We live right behind the pub and just walk right over!! Great service and probably one of the best Fish and chips!! Also their shepherds pie is pretty good! It's A really nice English pub. Makes me feel like I'm back in the UK. Clean. Plenty of space. Friendly staff. Restrooms clean. Good food. Great beer. Felt real welcome. Lots of parking. User friendly.  or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips "My favorite bar ever! Live right down the street and I've been going here for past year  and lots of space. It's a nice neighborhood bar. Cheers! :)"  and football scarves and flags adorn the walls. We sat in a booth and I ordered a burger while my wife tried a veggie curry. I wasn't impressed with the grub but it was cheap so can't complain. People come here to drink anyway Loved it and the owner was great.  Can't wait to go back." "The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However  it's not too loud to have a conversation. The beer selection is good and the drinks are strong so I felt I got my money's worth if your into pubs it's a good place." This is a very nice place to chill and hang out watch sports. They have full service bar and lots tables for large groups. I hear it gets crowded for sport games and on them weekend. Always friendly good service and casual environment to chat and talk. Great food & beer selection. Fun staff. very authentic looking bar. Their lunch specials are really good too.  Good place to watch sporting events. Highly recommend.  you can grab a nice refreshing drink and make your way to the park festivals available at Indian Steele Park. My favorite drink to order is the cucumber vodka and soda. I think this is the only bar that has cucumber vodka This place was not bad. Their draft milk stout was delicious and we ordered chips that were quick and tasty. The bartender Jen? Is a sweetheart. Will return.  takes a bit longer to get the ball rolling than needed." My test for the quality or likability of a restaurant has to do with would I return to the place and I have to say that this is one place I probably would return to solely with a large group of people who just want to hang have a little fun relax enjoy the atmosphere. You'll notice and some of the other reviews Thursday night is trivia night and the owner went through about 30 reasonably tough questions of succeeding difficulty. It's just kind of fun in the background with conversation and play while the rest of the crowd disappears in the background."  the owner is miserable and the food is terrible. It's amazing they have been in business this long." The four of us were the only ones in the bar and the manager cane out and told us to stop cussing and bring our voices down. We were literally the only ones in the bar. I just don't get it. Did he hate the gays? He for sure did not appreciate the business we brought him. Never going back again. Such a shame. I want to select zero stars but this app won't let me.  and great food and beer. This was a phenomenal first experience  it was alright. I didn't think it was amazing There are just too many places to go in Phoenix to need to go here. Beware of what you will get here."  but still good. Fries were a bit boring. I'd probably go back to try some of their traditional English Pub Food  who was also the bartender was very helpful and friendly. Made me a great bloody mary and I ordered the stuffed meatloaf. It was fantastic. Definitely going to be stopping in again."  but it was pretty good. I'll go back to find out how good is their fish and chips." 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg Came here while traveling through Phoenix a while back.  I got the pasty.  It came with some English sides.  I also used ketchup like a yooper.  Great dish.  Had the milk stout on tap.  Great choice.  noisy & filled with drunks playing cards including the owner. The food is equally terrible. There are just too many good places to waste time and money here. If you encounter the owner you will be surprised and very sorry." I guess see you again tomorrow...." great food ESP Sunday roast. brings a little bit of home to phoenix.  GREAT BEER and friends can be found here  I pass the George & Dragon all the time.  I've noticed there are always people out front on the porch (so it seems petty popular.)  My 90 year old grandma was visiting around Christmas and we stopped in for lunch one day.  This was intentional since she is from England and I wanted to take her to an ""authentic British pub"" to see what she thought.  She absolutely loved the fish and chips and I had the BLT which was awesome - curly bacon is the best!  We both enjoyed it a lot and Gram said the decor reminded her of the pubs in England.  A few days later we decided to go back for the roast dinner on Sunday and everything was great.  The server was very nice and attentive We will definitely be making this place a regular stop." Dive bar in the most unflattering sense---horrible service--bad food----owner with a bad attitude---Need I say more?  chill vibe. Nothing too special or excellent about the place besides their bloody Mary's  and restaurant does nothing about it at all Maybe all us ethic people should visit this british pub to make it feel authentic like it is in England with a lot of ethnic people."  he's kind of awesome."  and the manager left in the middle to take care of business. We were here on a Sunday and it was not that busy."  ask for water( just tap water nothing else.) It was cleared by one of the owners. They said they would fill up our two little water containers for a community event that I was working for.  It was a happy day the two of us from the event went in as happy as can be. When we got in my parter said ""hello"" we got ignored by one bar tender and one waitress. So we waited until they where ready to notice. Then the bar tender said just take a seat we will be with you. That's when we explain our purpose for the visit. The said no we don't know what your talking about. They rolled there eyes at us and just said we don't know anything. I said "A cool pub serving authentic English dishes. Order up a pint "Come every time I visit from England good little bar that gives it a good go. Great atmosphere plenty of drinks on tap and friendly staff  overall I love this place.  I will become my new bar in the future.  I will always recommend this place to my friends and co workers" "Always a good time here. The food is consistently good and the staff is awesome. Shout out to Laura  I love this place. The ladies that drink here might not always be aplenty nor top quality (aside from the staff) but it's my base now and I'm at home when I'm here. Keep 'em comin'."  it's old and kind of broken but I wouldn't change a thing." Keep up the awesome work!" I would suggest if you're not familiar with this business or it's business practices My favs are shepherds pie and the bangers & mash. Still need to try the fish & chips.. Heard it's amazing." "Nice environment. Waitress was awesome. Food was delicious. Had their zucchini sticks. Fish and chips Most authentic British Pug you can get in the Valley. Been going here for years and love it!  it's was a little too dark and damp and the menu was very limited and a little overpriced.  Seems like a good place to watch a soccer game Great for groups. The bloody Marie's are amazing! The atmosphere is great. It's a loud place but that's what I expect from a pub! So will come back!. 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg  go to the bar and wait. Awesome. Because why would I want to cone back to this. I shouldn't have to Google all the beer just to find something the slurp. The hostess didn't even know what the beers were. How can you work here every night and not know. Won't be back." Seems like management is non existent. Too bad. Supported this place quite a lot during the light rail construction. Show some love GD." "It's fine. Kind of a dive but it's cozy and quiet on weekdays. Service was nice. Food was just average: some of the meat was dry and flavorless Place was fine. Was a busy night. Started by getting drinks at the bar but ended up sitting at a high table. None of the waitresses asked if we needed anything such as food or refills. We didn't but it would have been nice to have been checked on. We were there for drinks and to relax. We will probably try it again.  when I have a craving for a scotch egg I'll be here in a heart beat." Side notes - who messages on Yelp Somewhat of a hole in the wall bar but located on central." A popular and busy pub on a Saturday night. A young crowd mostly men watching sports and drinking beer. However we were an older group there for the food. My fish and chiips was a generous but tasteless plate of heavily battered fish and chips. Would not recommend the food. 3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg  baseball and football when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.  The place wasn't busy at around 3:00 pm.  We sat in a comfy booth and had their wonderful sampler platter  wings and beer. Always chill and dart machines!" You should post a rainbow flag outside. The women there tonight were more masculine than the men. Good fish though.  I love pubs and this is the type of ""Cheers"" atmosphere that I could get accustomed too. Casey was our waitress and she was great  and great drinks. Had mozzarella sticks for happy hour and it was very disappointing. Besides that most things are good." This is a fine English pub! The shepherd's pie is delicious and the bangers and mash are spot on! I recommend them highly! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the music can be much too loud. The atmosphere is great and the employees  are fantastic! Like I get it.. It's pub food but I have worked in many in the past that were better quality. Js.. I'm the most non picky and laid back person. It takes a lot for me to even write a review ."  too. She offered to get a manager so I could discuss it with them. I declined since I have better things to do with my day off than argue that the kitchen should know how to cook the special properly. I did Google Yorkshire  Pudding and looked at all the images just to prove to myself that I was right about the golden brown they're supposed to be. I left very disappointed that my first taste of something I'd waited so long to try was so subpar. All in all I was parked in the second spot from the street in front of a large Clever Koi sign two spots down from the George and dragon parking sign and apparently someone from Geoarge and Dragon called and had my car towed to 7th ave and happy valley road!!! George and Dragon sucks.  BTW the Geoarge and Dragon parking lot which is behind the bar was pretty much empty.  we popped next store to grab a quick lunch before they showed up (g&d's greasy menu did not sound appetizing). When our friends arrived not more than 20 minutes later and we walked back over to find George had towed our car from the parking lot!! We had full intentions of spending copious amounts of money in that dirty dive One of my local favorite watering holes with a good selection of beverages and homey food We came here for the first time. Came with the kids and another family. The kids had the French toast sticks and they were really good (our kids are picky eaters). Having just traveled in Great Britain I find this establishment an insult to Queen and Country. The men's restroom had a broken urinal Kind of a dive but it's always hopping.  Not my personal scene but drinks came fast and food was ok.  We had a huge bar hopping crowd and it's nice that it is so close to the light rail stop for a good time. "If I could give less I would. Cool spot unless you're a woman getting harassed by male patrons. The ""security"" won't do anything except pat them on the back and bro up. Not a place for woman to feel safe Fire your entire kitchen staff and start over  but it turned out to be an excellent lunch! The best part of the experience hands down was the staff. They were friendly and accommodating. It's great to have English fare in Phoenix!!!!"  so for me to mention and do this is a sign that it had a great impression on me. You can't go wrong! Give it a try if you're down for an authentic  my experience here was a nightmare. You will never catch me in that place again."  maybe she just was distracted. It's cool. I'm a mellow dude. I go in and ask if I can also place an order and all will be well in the world. Right? She's busy entering orders into the POS computer.  She says she'll be with me in a minute.  Ok. Cool. A couple walks up next to me at the bar. She'll be with them in a minute.  Ok. cool...so I now assume I'll place my order and head back outside and then the couple that walked up after me will place their order and all will be well in the world. Right? She takes their order first! I'm annoyed because I was there first and I just got done chasing her down and well ok what ever so long as I get to order. So I wait. Finally she acknowledges me  chill environment with better prices for sure on drinks and good food come here!!! I'll definitely come back....and I never Yelp about anything!!!!"  and the food we tried was fine. So this review is really about the ambience." "Went in after Bar Rescue. I thought the changes were great! In the past the service wasn't very good and on our trip the servers were really attentive and very knowledgeable. I had always thought that the food was okay for bar food "0 stars....We waited for over  40 minutes after the beer fest...two servers and no menu or water offered...could not find a server....not prepared...not good..  there is no possible way that many  people are allowed in that size space. The manager wouldn't even assist when we asked for our tab. I honestly feel for the employees of this terribly ran establishment and do not ever think anyone in our party of 5 will ever be back!" Only thing - I miss the old booths. The new tables are pretty wobbly. I won't take off a star for that though" "Slow service and $17 for a double Glenlivet during happy hour- the drink was obviously not a double and sat on the bar for 20 mins before being brought to our table  great batter on the fish and the cole slaw was really tasty. My friends had bangers and mash which they raved about.  Casey introduced us to the owner Dave ...they're very excited about the upcoming Bar Rescue show. The positivity exuded by all the staff made our visit very special. We're ready to go back again soon.." "This was a neat little place. We tried it last night for the first time.  Nice choice of beers and a full bar. The service was a little slow  this one is pretty bad. They have the worst service I've ever seen in a pub. Their food isn't much better. The only good thing I can speak that they do well is consistency.  They are consistency awful. Even with their new renovation it just feels like they polished a turd." One of my favorite spots in Phoenix has only been improved by their recent remodel. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing a beer or a bite. "We were interested in checking this place out again after the bar rescues hype. The curry was all sold out so I ordered the shepards pie. It was a huge portion of bland food. Also had the pretzel for an appetizer. The pretzel was obviously previously frozen and the cheese on the side was from a vat. Would not recommend. Fianc had a bland burger "Lovely authentic British Pub as it should be.Never miss a chance to go.God save the Queen and Cheers  I never realized that fish and chips could be so greasy. I needed Tums to help my heartburn. Maybe order something less fried if you choose this spot? Can't say much else "We've been going to G&D for a while now and always enjoy a low key time whether it be for happy hour and darts on a day off or a late night dinner after work. Staff is always great and the food is too. Last night I had the stuffed meat loaf and was blown away! I also really enjoy the wings! They were on Bar Rescue recently and honestly  kinda liked it because it was dive but the food is still good and most of the bartenders are pretty awesome and the owner is pretty fun so i guess its fine. Best wings EVA!" Really doesn't matter. I'm not coming back. damn shame." The food here is really good...the problem is the service. It wasn't very busy but we waited a very long time for our drinks and then even longer for the food. It got to the point where we wondered if we should leave or not because we had other places to be. We were there a little over an hour for just getting a bite to eat. Very awesome if you have the time and don't mind slow waiting. Prices are reasonable and food is DELISH! So is the IPA I also like the fish and chips and flaming chicken creole. They've revamped the menu Great atmosphere and cheap beer.  Owner is a great guy that has a lot of pride in his establishment and is very friendly.  Honey sriracha wings are delicious.  which are a fun time. I ordered an English kebab which was seasoned and tasty (English version of a gyro). My friend had ordered the Cornish Pastie and couldn't stop raving about it. Overall  not cold. Took about 20 minutes to get potato skins after we placed our order. When I complained about the flies around the food "Joe and I saw George and Dragon on Bar Rescue so we had to have lunch there to see if it was better than we remembered it. If you like English food  as well as some beer. I thought it was delicious compared to last time I was here! My friend enjoyed their food as well. I can't say anything about the mixed drinks because we didn't have any. But very good service and food! I will be back!" George and Dragon gets a solid C from me." Love this place and will continue to go! The honey siracha wings are amazing! Their beer is always great. Derek M. ""Blues Fan"""  the plate with the food on it came dirty and the order was wrong. The reason why they get only 2 stars is for poor customer service. The server wouldn't even smile. It almost felt like he could care less that we were there. He never checked on how the food was. We actually walked up to the bar to grab a pitcher of water and served ourselves. Never heard from him after that. We had to walk back up to the bar to pay for our meal as well. But Love the new changes and look however the service was poor. Very disappointed. Could be better  the food is very good. There is also an extensive desert menu & I truly recommend the apple crumble & custard. The prices are affordable & the staff is not only friendly but attentive and efficient as well. YAY! G&D!!"   I don't care what the TV show did to you. Everyone I know hates the fact that the booths are gone.  That is 30% of the reason I come there."  but I loved my first experience tonight. My party felt the same way and we'll be back."  outdoor seating...karaoke night on Mondays. Food is also so good" Tell us to grab any seat.. Friday 830p. Never come to take an order. Never will be back
