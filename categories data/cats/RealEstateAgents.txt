 it makes sense to work with the best and that's what the Russell Shaw group is all about.  We are on home #4 and every one has been easy  our house closed 2/29/16 and the blue lockbox is still hanging in our door 3/10. She was rude when I needed info regarding who treated our house for termites. I would never recommend them to work with." You cannot go wrong with Shaw."  but I got the same result as if I had. I would not hire them if Russell Shaw himself came by and offered his services for free. They are doing a disservice to their clients
