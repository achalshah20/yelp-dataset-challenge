 but paying that much for so little was a huge disappointment especially after seeing very high marks for this place on citysearch."  and college-age groups enjoying hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area.  Some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music.  It fits in well with the decorated interior that's covered in arches an paintings (some on animal skins).  Service has been great 2 3 visits  though drier than the overly syrupy version" The Food was very delicious and it was a nice and calm place with great hookahs Definitely a must try in Charlotte!"  but the hookah was overpriced. The decor was unusual and everything could have used a good cleaning and a coat of paint. I won't be back to Kabob House."  and then they pull some tables together and the entire staff sits down for dinner in the front of the restaurant. We waited another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to come back and ask if we were finished or wanted dessert. The answer was a resounding no." This place was garbage for hookah.  They didn't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose.  Definitely avoid like the plague if you want to keep your lungs free of fungus.  but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers."  but there are plenty of couches chairs in the back. The DJ was good given what he had to work with and he got people dancing. So all of that does not equal 3 stars. What does jump it up to 3 starts is the food. The kabobs were amazing melt in your mouth. They were out of chicken so we got steak and definitely good food. The hummus was good as well. Overall due to location I probably wouldn't come back unless someone really wanted to go And the box for the food is 5$."
