Been there twice so far and have to say Maggie is so sweet and very knowledgeable. She listens to your concerns and gives you advice outside of acupuncture to help with your problem. The office is very clean and easily accessible to anyone who lives in the south hills. I will definitely go back."  debilitating migraines!!! I had tried every OTC med you could think of and vitamin regimen! I figured I would try this since I wasn't seeing a neurologist for several months... After 3 visits seeing Maggie Several months later and I'm still migraine free!"
