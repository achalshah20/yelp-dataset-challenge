 make sure you call and make an appointment. This is my go-to nonprofit to donate my precious O negative. Save three lives Now I donate whole blood. The staff is always friendly and there is never too long of a wait. Parking and easy and the facility is very clean. And since you can only donate whole blood every 8 weeks or so Courteous staff and volunteers. Safe and efficient. In and out quickly. Very clean. "My wife and I donate blood and platelets every 6 weeks.  This is where we go and the people that work here are friendly  painless  donation process.  I love the ARC and this is my absolute favorite place to donat" I always feel better after donating. I feel like it's cleansing."
