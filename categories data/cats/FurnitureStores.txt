 I am a satisfied customer. I recommend this company if you are looking for contemporary furniture with a traditional flair."  an eccentric associate greeted me. I definitely plan to return to the store in the future when I'm looking to refresh my super-comfortable family room sofa."  meaning not for small space living.  Are you a leather lover with a nice big room to furnish - go here!  Big traditional furnishings with a smattering of the unexpected to keep things interesting and fresh.  Staff is helpful but not pushy  sturdy shelves come in several stained finishes.   Arhaus delivers which is good for heavier items.  Also eye catching are their various desks.  They have a nice showroom in Shadyside across from Madmex"  trying to concoct a payment plan or get-rich-quick scheme in my head that would allow me to buy them (Sell my plasma? Sell my body? Eat nothing but Saltines for six months?) The prices are steep  but was nicer than your average box store.  The counter girl never looked up once the entire time I was in there--I guess she could sense I was just a browser." "The place is the most gorgeous shopping in the city. I feel like they crawled in my brain. My 7 year old danced around like we were in a fairy forest because she loved it so much! The items here are custom made Stopped in looking to furnish my new apartment. I was the only customer in the place on a weekday afternoon. I was never greeted by sales staff or acknowledged. There was an older woman and a younger woman working. As I was browsing the jewelry the older woman said loud enough so I could hear for the younger sales associate to watch me so I didn't steal anything. And I'm a white young professional so I can only imagine how other people are treated.  at least for Christmas presents. there just seems to be a lot of this kind of thing these days. even though this store has been around for quite a while."  but you can always dream... and buy smaller items to feel fancy!" Beautiful store. It's like a hybrid of the quirky doodads sold at Francesca's with the thoughtful set displays at Anthropologie but with a more authentic feel. I wanted to look around more but I can't shop peacefully when I'm with my husband. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the strip district.  haven't actually purchased any of their larger pieces because 1. They expensive! And 2. I live in a tiny house and a lot of their furnishings are a little on the large side. It's also an amazing place to just come for ideas "Really wonderful place to get ideas. It has a very 'bazaar' like feel which I enjoy because you can just walk around to soft music and let different things catch your eye. I bought two pendant lamps from here for my dining room and they are stunning. There are a lot of upmarket pieces but also really cute trinkets and other items that are much more affordable. It really just depends on your taste. Visit this place when you have time to peruse I think I just found the store equivalent of a soulmate Great products and Katie has been the best! Just be careful...RH has so many awesome products that it'll be hard to leave empty-handed! Especially if the service is always as good as our experience!" "I have no problem with the product of the actual store but the delivery service they use is delivering the piece of furniture I got 1 week and a half after I bought (even though it was in stock at the store) on a weekday with a 4 hour time frame. I paid $125 for shipping. What a rip off Great quality furniture and shower curtains but way to overpriced for example a shower curtain is $90 there and some of the employees including the manager gather in a group and just talk. I went there tonight and all I had to do was return a towel and buy a couple new ones and it took me 40 minutes to do that  however I was a little disappointed in the inventory in the store.  I was searching for ideas for media consoles and at best they seemed to have 1-2 differing styles.  There are a ton of them online  the staff is exhausted when I ask questions and they put you down for bothering them.  They make me feel unappreciated and and forget It's like a higher end tchotchke store.  Sure you could find something of your interest in there  the staff here is very nice." I only wish I had more time to shop!" My sister and I are 2 professional women (Chemist Psychologist) we were surprised to witness this type of treatment from furniture salesmen. But I guess when you walk into this location with the wrong skin color you get no service... 2014MLK Day... Smh" "In the past when my husband and I needed to purchase good quality furniture we always went to Walter E Smith in the Chicago area.  Since living here we made the change to Ethan Allen.  We purchased a full living room from them this past spring and have been very happy with almost everything.  The service was great and the sales person listened to us and put together exactly what we wanted with one exception.  We asked for tables (specifically a coffee table) that could stand up to some abuse because we have a 16 month old at home.  The table he recommended is beautiful but does not at all stand up to what he said it would.  This table is only 3 1 2 months old and already has wood chipping off  even though we said we were ready to buy. Ethan Allen Pineville just didn't care. We called corporate to voice our concern and were told someone would follow up with us; of course that never happened. So the Pineville  store didn't care for our money  there are plenty of furniture stores nearby! I give this place stars for the great recliner Excellent customer service by Dawn Shaffer! Delivery of the furniture was professional and on time. Thank you for an overall great experience! Sales ticket # 161-31137" "This store is TERRIBLE. Delivered a sofa they cut while unpacking. Didn't notice it till they left. Took 4 days to pick up the cut sofa! They were then 3 hours late picking it up!  I wanted refund and am still waiting for it! TERRIBLE. Assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance. Lied. In this day and age you can get anybody on the phone Finally I've called corporate several times and they have not gotten back to me. Good job La-Z-Boy  you definitely want to check this place out. It is a HUGE warehouse full of everything you could need for your home at awesome prices. It's not set up to look as nice as other decor stores  but sometimes you've gotta hunt and peck through their warehouse of merchandise to find just that thing you want need at the price you want to pay.  It's that giant building behind the Carolina Place mall that looks like a Home Depot at first glance." Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!! I'll be back for the 6'0"" Knight in Shining Armor one day!" I love this store and wish i could spend hours here"  it's probably only going to last a season or two. But do I really want to pay three times as much for something that will last forever? Sorry  is very organized.  I can spend hours upon hours in the different areas looking at merchandise for each room of the house.  From cookware to holiday items to rugs for my foyer.  And my last trip was just amazing.  I had to return to select items that were a better match for my decor.  The sales person....simply glowed and sparkled with the greatest smile. She handled the return and provided great directions to different areas I needed to visit.  Upon checking out.....I was fortunate enough to have the same salesperson...this time glowing even more as she had spent time rearranging trees that were full of glitter to keep the store in order!!!  I will return to the store for the great merchandise and the sparkling service offered by Ms. Glitter!!!"  they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?" Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge.  of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease!" Love this place. We go here every year for Christmas ornaments and decorations. I love the variety of home decor you can find here.  sometimes too much. This is the first time in my life I called a business and pressed option to speak to sales associate and had to pull over and write down a number to another state. Call that Texas number 4693407490 to ask a charlotte employee about item in the store???"  lots of spaces...Thank goodness!!! Oh! I almost forgot to talk about the candles! Tons of options to choose from "Not very impressed with my last two trips here. The prices seem to be getting higher and the quality is diminishing. I asked for help on my second trip and the two ladies were too busy talking to really care about my needs. Then I had to wait in a line of about 20 people when they had one cashier working. They ended up calling two more over I can't say I am through with this place. I'm not aware of any other spots that offer Christmas decorations or just home stuff at more affordable prices. I'll limit my visits until I find that treasure." The pricing is very reasonable (more on the 'cheap' side) and the place is huge! I recommend coming here for something specifically in mind or you will become overwhelmed very fast." wo woo wow wow. Have you seen this place. Let me tell you if you want selection its the place to go. Its huge and the prices seemed ok. I just ran in to take a quick look and almost fell over at the size of the place.  I do not have to waste my hard earned money with a company that has horrible customer service and treats me like krap. I will never shop here again." She said 'All custom orders take longer than 6-8 weeks'.  So I said 'Why did Kevin  (my salesperson) tell me that it would be 6-8 weeks then?  Is he new here?'  Of course the answer is that I was MISLEAD KNOWINGLY by the sales staff and once they got my check for nearly $5k they completely stopped concerning themselves with my order.  So yes I feel USED AND ABUSED but lesson learned...sigh.....Please be exceptionally careful with any Bassett store and NEVER BUY CUSTOM FURNITURE!!!!!!  I hate you Bassett!!!  (P.S. I will be honest and update this review if it comes sooner by some miracle from heaven or if they refund my shipping cost.)" "These people are very difficult to do business with.  The saleswoman was downright arrogant.   I am assuming the furniture we ordered will come as promised.  But if I could have found what we wanted elsewhere - rest assured - I would have gone elsewhere.  Have never seen a store with so many ""rules"" in terms of buying an item. The paperwork is threatening.  I almost laughed in her face when she offered us an ""accident"" policy for the furniture and made us sign a release when we wouldn't buy it.  She muttered that ""almost everybody buys this."".  Seriously???  I think the furniture is decent quality but the way these people treat their customers is astounding at best." Net is that Bassett did an excellent job in meeting our needs.  Very professional and easy to work with." Please save yourself the frustration and refuse all Guardsman warranty plans!"  and well done.  I was able to take advantage of one of your special sales and get the product I have been wanting at an excellent saving.  Very happy customer."""  in fact she didn't really seem interested if I bought anything or not.  She was very nice but seemed a bit miffed because I was indecisive.  I ended up picking a great piece of furniture that I am in love with and will have for many years to come."""  and it ended up being ready in just two weeks. There were many options for delivery times and the crew was fast and professional. The quality of the sectional is excellent fqFWad8GW178xzzC4A4ZEA """Customer service was amazing. Susan really went out of her way to help us get matching bar stools to our kitchen table. Will definitely buy again from Bassett in Pineville "We worked with Ann and have worked with her in the past for other projects.  She is very easy to work with Visited Basset Furniture again to complete our daughter's bedroom that we had started.  We worked with Ann again and were very pleased with the end results of our daughter's bedroom.  Not only does the furniture look great but the quality is very good too.  Our delivery went smooth without a problem.  We plan on updating a second bedroom soon and will definitely be visiting Ann again at Bassett Furniture in Pineville.  and not one person came to talk with us. Not only did they not ask to help us as we walked around several associates Made another entire bedroom set purchase from Ann.  Ann contacted us when the store was having a fantastic sale on a bedroom set we were interested in purchasing.  She saved us a  ton of money!  The delivery was prompt and went smooth.  There were a few blemishes on the furniture delivered and Lisa contacted us about 10 minutes after the delivery to setup a time when someone could come and take a look at the blemishes and repair them.  We have never been disappointed with Basset and their customer service is the best!  Would recommend anyone looking for furniture to try Basset. fqFWad8GW178xzzC4A4ZEA  and were promised a delivery date and window which were followed through on. Several days before our scheduled delivery we went back looking for a second couch and sideboard. The salesman was so helpful -  we told him our price range and what we were looking for and he got it right on the first shot And if you're even 1 day late they slap you with a 39.99 late fee and then you get to argue about it with someone obviously on a different continent.  It's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer.  They're in the business of making money off of late fees which is never a way to make customers happy."  he took our email address ""just in case there are any changes to the pickup date"" - but of course the next day we get advertisements to the email address which was only going to be used to alert us to pickup issues. Bait and switch and charging for things behind your back.  Just be careful and you can get out with your wallet and email intact!" bqmWxho70VwNyl9yudP4Gw I plan to make Rooms to Go my place to go for any other furniture we may need. We will be in the market for a sofa or chairs coming up and this is definitely where we will begin our search."  go across the street to Ashley....... to follow up 10 30.... got a call from a regional manager apologizing for the way I was treated. After MANY phone calls they did the right thing and honored the price I paid for the sofa. I did get an apology and that did help Shouldn't even get a star b c this company is horrible b c the customer service on the phone when I was trying to pay my bill was very rude b c I was about 45mins late from the cutoff time and they charged me a late fee. I will never shop here again. Ashley furniture will get my business from now on.  the two individuals delivering the furniture were very unprofessional and cursed when we informed them of this. At first they said they are unable to do so. We contacted the customer service line and they said that the delivery service is subcontracted and they couldn't do anything. We then contacted the delivery service and they stated that they would dissemble the bedframe but would not put it back together. They then stated they need to speak with the delivery men who proceeded to make a scene in our front yard about it.  Again  and they purchased the extra warranty after being told it covered 100% of  product issues.  The quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor. The store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the.  The store said they were sorry the furniture  warped and the covering was peeling "The worst customer service ever! I went in for a re-selection (exchange) within 24hrs of my purchase and I was treated in the worst manner possible. They already had my money "Absolutely horrible.....I purchased a carriage bed for my daughter. She was super excited and counting down the days until arrival.  They delivered the bed without screws! Then they basically said they could do nothing for 2-3 days.  My daughter will be devastated.  I know some people may say what's a few days but tell that to a 5 year old that just saw her brother get his bed delivered. What kind of company is this? They have completely horrible So sorry to see such a wonderful company in years past ll be ok but I hope that at least one person that reads this post goes else where it is worth it. Business is only as good as your word and RTG word is useless. After buying $20000.00 worth of furniture from RTG I will never step foot in the store again. The pineville manager promised he would look into it and call me the following day. That never happened. Buy with confidence and not RTG" "It was hard to get any help and when you eventually get help they end up trying to sell you things you don't need and manipulate you to thinking you need all this extra stuff. For example all we wanted was a couch. We were told it would have been cheaper to get the set with the two tables and a lamp! Thinking back and forth on it didn't seem right. We finally read the fine line back to the sales rep and told her we didn't need to get all the extra stuff and it was apparently cheaper. Her response was ""oh I didn't know sorry"".  We eventually got what we wanted but we it seem like we had to fight our way to really get what we wanted. I felt like we were at a car dealer ship the whole time we were there! Reading the other reviews I'm hoping I get my order on time with everything in tact!" "So I've bought furniture from them before and usually it's a good experience. **BUYER BEWARE** of items sold off of the floor.  I should have stayed to look at a rug we bought off of the floor before he folded it up but Ray our sales associate was really pushy to get us to grab the car. Needless to say he was a nice salesman but he knew that the color would be off where the furniture had been sitting on it and where all the traffic from buyers would be stepping on it. Usually when it's too good to be true it is! Orig. $399 and got it for $160.....but we'll see if we can steam clean it and get some of the stain out. So don't give RAY (Asian guy) your business.....we bought a $2500 sofa set as well and he could have at least tried not to dupe us into getting the measley few dollars more commission and told us the rug wasn't worth it. Cmon man....honest living...be good to your buyers that's how you get repeat business. Instead now I have to put you on blast for being dirty! Please take into acct what others have said. The customer service was great for the most part but when you spend $2500 and you can't even tell the buyer that a $160 rug off of the floor isn't worth it I WAS CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL PURCHASES AT A LATER DATE.  BUT FORGET THIS  piece of crap and the service is appalling .Don't fall for their gift card deals like we did."  and most of it is the same no matter where it comes from.  I like the style of the furniture I bought -- it's perfect for my boys I had read so many negative reviews but was desperate to get some new and affordable furniture.  The salesman that helped us was so nice and did not put any pressure on us.  The delivery driver called 30 minutes prior to delivery and showed up promptly with our furniture.  They were polite and courteous and moved the furniture in in no time at all.  It was wrapped in pads and blankets to protect it.  30 minutes after delivery someone from the store called to see how delivery went.  I could not be more pleased with the process.  Highly recommend! "This is by far the absolute worst furniture experience I have encountered.  We visited the store on a Saturday and of course were met at the door by the hungry wolves (sales).  We informed the lady we were just looking and continued walking.  The sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes.  After about an hour of looking   I would recommend Leslie's as they just have a much wider selection of stock in the store. However The qualify of the product is TBD. I visited other stores after and simply noticed a higher mark-up for some of the same items." There are better places to shop with better prices"  some outside vendors rent space here). But the range is so wide you are sure to find something here that suits your taste. So set aside a few hours HORRIBLE.  I ordered a piece of furniture in September that was supposed to take six weeks to deliver.  It is Christmas and I still don't have it.  They don't answer phone calls or emails in a timely fashion  or at all.  I can't cancel or they will charge me $300 restocking fee and delivery.  What a joke.  Thanksgiving and Christmas ruined by these jerks because I have no seating.  NEVER AGAIN Nice store to browse a bit pricey though.... where Did you get it""?to which I reply ""BLACK LION""." Prices - It is pricey! I was able to do well by not buying much This is a great store to spend hours in just browsing. Lots of interesting items.  so they gladly shipped it.  They arrived perfectly.  Wish they had one of these in San Diego.  Maybe my pocketbook is safer that they don't.  I could get in serious trouble here." What a fun place to get ideas for your house! They have over 100 booths from different vendors selling everything from jewelry to furniture. We spent a few hours here and bought a few unique treats! "I had a great experience buying my furniture from them BUT if you need any service after the purchase good luck.  3 phone calls and 2 emails later and I still haven't received any help.  I spent about $10K with them and just need a contact number to get a motor replaced on one of my Theater seats purchased through them that is not covered under warranty.  NO HELP at all.  Be careful if you need any warranty work or service after the fact  they have a good Antique Mall and most of their stuff is good"  overpriced craft show by means of how the store is set up.  I simply cannot see spending 90 dollars on a pillow from this place though.  I might go back but more to look for inspiration or ideas  waiting to be shipped. When I received an email notifying me that my sofa was ready and that I would receive shipping notification I was anticipating its arrival within a timely period thereafter. After hearing nothing for a week I emailed. I was told it would take two weeks to receive a call from the shipping company. After two weeks I emailed again (3 times) and was ignored. I finally received a call after threatening to call my credit card company and I received a phone message telling me they would be loading the truck that week and would deliver two weeks out. It takes a week to load a truck? I was finally called by the delivery company and told my delivery would be two more weeks out and I received a call today from the delivery company telling me the delivery was delayed yet another week. Do NOT buy anything from this company if you live out of state. I have never experienced such poor customer service from any company and I am disgusted that I was charged in full when the sofa was completed  both inside and out. The furniture offerings are great and the staff is always helpful. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and plan to spend a couple of hours roaming all of the different booths!" Blacklion has been around for 20 years.  It's very dated and in need of remodeling.  It has visible roof leaks.  When it's raining they put garbage cans in the aisles (especially on the left side of the building).  There is only one small public restroom and no organization to the layout.  There is no security cameras in the parking lot.  There have been many smash and grab incidences reported.  and other gadgets.  Everything in the store is brand-new but has a retro feel to it.  It's much more fun to browse through than Pottery Barn!  Right on IzRwj5F_3h0oIC3SIdrOEA IzRwj5F_3h0oIC3SIdrOEA The NEW look of Restoration Hardware is Big and very masculine!  Looks like a Movie Set - in a good way! The only upside is that from the reviews I've read online about the actual quality of their products "I have bought several things from this store. I've also ordered a lot from RH online. I went in a few weeks ago to order a bench to match my bed. I was disappointed that they can't ship smaller items to the store to avoid shipping charges. Other furniture stores like Pottery Barn have this option. Overall I love RH and their products Adding another two stars! My husband and I were really pleased with the customer service during our last trip to RH. We were greeted promptly by Gregory and he helped us throughout our entire purchase. He helped us to choose the right colors and products that we were going back and forth between. He was incredibly insightful. I'm not a designer and have trouble visualizing the products in my home. It can be overwhelming. I'm spending a lot of money here and I want to know what I'm choosing will look wonderful in my home! We will definitely be asking for Gregory next time we buy more furniture from RH because he designed and imagined things with us and made us feel comfortable with our ideas. His suggestions were on point and he steered us in the right direction!  I have been brought to tears and all I have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude. When I complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all I have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me. At one point told him I would be telling everyone I came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been "Absolutely terrible customer service.  Walked in and no one never said hello.  Proceeded to look around and then had a sales rep walk right by me and still I was not greeted.  Then once I needed some help I walked up to the counter and stood there for several mins before someone finally said do you need some help.  Once they answered my questions they said you welcome (following my thank you) and that was it... Not even a have a nice day once I left.  Would have been nice to have followed with ""let me know if you need help with anything else"". I felt very neglected and will not be shopping directly at this store again!!!  I've worked over 12 years of retail and this is not how its done.  Good thing I wasn't a secret shopper." I truly loved coming here right after grabbing some coffee or water from Dean & Deluca and just hanging out I have since been to the store twice and the service is on point and I am looking forward to my upcoming meeting to discuss my ideas."  ask a representative (because they will rarely approach you) which color is the cheapest and will get to you the quickest if you don't wish to wait. Lucky for us  but because of the nature of the place nothing is guaranteed to be there." Discovered this place td. I think it's one to pop in while in the area to see if you're lucky. Parking is abundant but that doesn't mean they don't hv a lot.  so I suggest it to get an idea of what you like."  and accent pieces are very good.  Sometimes you can find pieces crafted with dovetail craftmanship!  I usually end of selling or giving the rug away b c they last forever if you keep a good routine (clean once every three months and vacuum every week).  I bought a couch and loveseat from here also and I don't like it at all.  So before you decided to buy a sofa set from here first check and make sure that it' built strong.  One person falls down too hard and the wood underneath cracks splits breaks.  Also WORST PLACE EVER!!! DON'T go!!!  Very rude.  The return policy is horrible!!!  Next day delivery means sit home ALL day from 7am-10pm. for broken furniture to be delivered. Stay away from sales person Kevin.   Ask to see the terms and conditions!!!  Before signing anything!!! vKHZVUwW1ewZju0PgeBbmg Staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. The company never responded to my questions in the store or online. Was willing to purchase high priced items with cash and couldn't get any help.  Worse experience ever. Worst delivery experience ever.  Driver used my bathroom and left the seat up.  He put the furniture together on my front lawn and refused to take my old mattress.  Told me that customer service wouldn't be open till 10 (delivery was at 7am) and when I refused to sign he just left.  I called customer service and they were zero help.  ""Let me go and get him for you."" She made it clear that she wasn't in the mood to help me or the other customer who was also seeking help. Anthony ended up helping us both."  but this will be my final purchase from them. EVER. I would rather pay double for something and deal with a business that gives a damn about their customers and doing the right thing than to give Rooms to Go another penny of my money."  but I the quality isn't the greatest. The selling factor for this furniture store is the price. If you're looking for something to own for about 3-5 years or are on a budget this might be your prefect fit. Also they seem to love leather sectionals here so if that's your thing this might be a good starting point in your search." This store has the worst and I mean worst customer service I have ever experienced!  Ordered furniture and paid for it in full.  Come to find out 5 days later they don't have it and won't have it for 4 months!  I tried to cancel the order and they said they can try to cancel it but it will take a while!!!  Really?  Very quick to take my money...but do not want to give it back in a timely manner.  Still no refund after 3 days....still waiting.  Do not do business with this company.  I am in process of disputing the charge now with my credit card company. Having said that...  Buyer beware."  we were to the point of being upset. We get home and we noticed the coffee table was opened and repackaged. When we open it  uncomfortable and just sad. I also never received the proper cushions for it. Do not buy this couch!! Total waste of 2500$!" Best customer service!   Will do returns with a smile.  looked good but mechanically was unsound. I called a national number as instructed and eventually someone came to look at it. Parts were ordered and someone else came and put in part of the repairs  we ordered a piece of furniture and received the product survey before it even arrived ... Nice!  The survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment. Our salesperson was nice enough to deliver the piece; however  it hasn't gotten any better. I talked to our salesperson last Friday and La Z Boy has not even looked at (it's been 6 days) our piece of furniture. He apologized and assured me that the manager would call to explain. Five days have passed and we have yet to receive a call! Is there a Lemmon law for retailers?  Unless you are yearning for disappointment  but I do not know if I will go back. I felt like I did not want to offend them so I saw there longer than I wanted to." I have been to many stores in the area and won't go any where else but La-Z-Boy.  The experience was no pressure and they came to my house to help me with my whole room.  The sales associate and designer were great.  I love my new room.  Will go back when I finish my lower level. Do yourself a favor and check out Sikers before you buy from them You'll save yourself lots of money like I did." Hopefully I'll be back for a dining room table ($399)  not too pushy. Higher quality most of the time over what you will find at particle board shops like Ikea The only downside to shopping there is their strict no refund/no exchange policy.  They will not budge under any circumstances.  I just got burned on that a few weeks ago on a new sofa and chair.  Rubin's Clearance Center is fine for smaller purchases.  For more expensive items  Rubin's Clearance was the first place we stopped. We found a great quality all wood bed at a great price and a Rubin's mattress and we love it. The salesperson was not pushy and very helpful. In fact  so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K  jand I have been going back and forth on a wooden credenza for his office. They aren't easy to find. My dad sells higher end furniture back in Ohio so I can be a little picky and snooty when it comes to furniture and it's quality. Just like how I am with wine. Ok that was totally uneccessary. No wine in the review. We didn't need wine after a trip to Don's because the powner was extremely helpful. He showed us a few options that he had on the floor then took almost a half hour to sketch out a customized credenza that his Amish builders can make for us. The process was not overwhelming at all. J searched through a digital portfolio of samples while I searched through a binder of selcted styles. The owner actually helped guide us through the process as well. So you basically are working with a designer should you choose to have Don's build your furniture for you. Ok  they seem to be catering to Baby Boomer generation style. Us younger customers would find a lot to love if they could offer a larger selection of updated pieces (e.g.  all really good quality and extremely cheap. Very painless shopping and very good stuff. Delivery was also fine and inexpensive." Once again we needed furniture and Quality Furniture was the first place we thought to go.  Danny and Joey are always so helpful and easy to work with! We will continue to make Quality Furniture our #1furniture store! I highly recommend them and will definitely buy my next mattress from them."  as they are owned and operated by the same man.                                                                                               SCAMMERS if you chose What a great experience!  Thumbs waaaaay up!"  with good staff who can answer your questions and provide good space planning advice.  The showroom is pretty large I bought furniture in Nov 2013. I was told 2 weeks.  It came in jan but there was a problem with the fabric on the chairs. It is now almost July and no resolution to the problem Still no chairs.  Supposedly they are ordered.  It is almost 9 full months now since we ordered our furniture and this problem has not been resolved. Still nothing from the store.  No call. No replacement furniture.  Wordy customer service. Finally they delivered a new set of chairs and exchanged the ones I had.  They are better but still not great.  You be the judge on whether or not you would buy from a store that takes almost a year to resolve a problem.  At one point the general manager stopped talking to me and turned my problem over to the assistant manager.  Way to go Rich.  until one rep (not the manager who was helping us) continuously reminded kids not to touch the decorations. From the beginning we took turns looking after the kids Carter's management could have been more polite and helpful in my situation. I was actually surprised at the way I was being treated. I have since turned away several friends from visiting their showroom."  this is a fun store to browse and you always feel welcome." GpMijrYiLAU0FdOQo9Af_w I got an awesome 60's vinyl couch for 200$!"  even factoring in the expensive nature of these ""vintage"" stores.  While I went looking for paintings and other decorations for my apartment They recently started taking credit via Square reader in their new downtown Champaign location."  somethings can be a little pricey-- but coming from the West Coast they are always cheaper than what I would pay back home."  and Amanda and Scott are the best.  From Soviet matryoshki to Herman Miller side-boards this duo has a great eye for the bygone style of the mid-century.  This shop is a true treasure for Champaign's mods." It's worth it to go in and take a look. Lots of fun things to see and buy!" "THE F N BEST. Did I really start this review like that? yep. I kinda want everything in the store when I go in. The owners are knowledgable and nice  and it is always fun just to stop in and see what's new. So far we have bought from them: two chairs and end table for the living room "Yay yay yay! This place looks as if the owners just raided the set of Mad Men. They always have rad stuff every time I come in here. So much so that I'm to the point where I don't let myself go here because I'm afraid I'll buy something. Yeah This shop is full with charlatans that will do and say anything to sell you a bed!!! Don't make the same mistakes we made thinking this was a serious company .... IS A TRAP!!!!" I will never buy another Sleep Number Bed and would not recommend anyone else go through this headache." If you are thinking of getting a new mattress and are ""OLD SCHOOL"" like myself you really should try this place! If I didnt love my mattress soooo much and wasn't stuck in the 80's I would have walked with a new mattrress today...who knows .. maybe tomorrow!! Just letting my yelper friends know this product rocks and so do the employees here! Tell them Deb sent you...okay "I've shopped here often over the years and have always been satisfied with the products purchased or the return policy if I wasn't.  Lots of items to choose from and yet lots still unavailable that should be there.  Was in there recently to buy some new non-stick pans and asked a guy if they had individual pans of certain brands rather than just sets.  He disinterestedly showed me a few things that were already in plain sight and left it at that.  I saw a young lady helping another customer and asked her.  She showed me exactly where to find the items I was searching for (not in plain sight).  Headed towards the cashier and realized I'd left my store coupon home.  With 20% off on an $80 saute pan "Came by here looking for a new medicine cabinet (being my bathroom is lacking one) as well as a new 10"" saute' pan. The staff are virtually walking around like zombies and tend ignore you (unless of course you act like an extra on the Walking Dead  but we did manage to provide an apartment of 20-year-old guys with all the homey things they don't know yet that they need!"  you have to always use it to make the prices more reasonable." "Never anyone around to help. Items listed on website and listed as ""in stock"" with the store location can't be found. Easier to use Amazon.com."  and eames era furnishing. The furniture is lovely- but the prices are SKY HIGH. Expect to pay top dollar for you won't find any bargains here. With that being said (Side note:  The store also carries art and a small selection of vintage clothing and accessories.)" "This is a stunning vintage modern showroom with more of the same furnishings for sale inside.  Unfortunately Everything is beautiful in there.  It's like going to MOMA. I can't believe it's in Phoenix! THANK GOODNESS! This is the place that has everything I've ever dreamed about.  I'm saving up for this gorgeous vintage hanging chair.  I hope it doesn't sell before I get my hands on it. The owner here is really cool and encourages you to look around even if they know that you probably can't afford anything there (like they did with me). Another thing about the owner at Red Modern Furniture is that she's really passionate about what she does and I thought that it was really cool that I could talk to her about what was in the store."  and is always willing to help.  It's worth a visit even if you aren't considering making an actual purchase.  There are things there that you won't see anywhere else in this state."  making sure we didn't touch anything at all. It's a frickin' furniture store! How can you not be allowed to sit on the couches? I don't care if they're vintage or antiques or the like We found some really great pieces we liked that would work perfectly in our home.  And some we fell in LOVE with other stuff but have not purchased.  It is pricey but they are like pieces of fine art.  It is Eames-era heaven.  There is the most beautiful desk I have ever seen and other pieces that just left me in awe.  If this is your style  so my only hang-up with Red is that a lot of neat stuff does not have price tags; who knows We now are on the verge of a full-blown vintage furniture addiction that is only being held back by our income. I've actually considered putting off plans to travel the world and raise a family in order to get the perfect coffee table." kb_gDoTlPHf_Pk-L9sGMtA The vibe is not my kind of phoenix vibe.  I've probably been in the store 10-20 times and have either received no greeting or a cold/frosty one.  For that reason alone I don't want to give them my money."  the prices are sky high (although that doesn't mean that isn't room to bargain) and the staff is extremely unfriendly. I would rather shop on Ebay or go pay full price at Lumature or Design Within Reach." "How incredibly pathetic.  I just had the worst experience at Red.  Then I get on Yelp and realize how many others have come to the same conclusion--enough to write about it!  How can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly.  Wow.  I was seriously shocked--zero personality and 100% icy and rude--as if they didn't even want you in the store.  So why did they open one?  Even if I found the perfect piece items are nicely arranged but prices are too high!  and everything I asked for pricing on was strangely $1000 + (even a lamp I already owned and paid $20 for at a thrift store).  It was as if he didn't think I was worthy of owning any of his furniture.  I have since frequently seen him at estate and yard sales around phoenix  she said ""I don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars I can't afford. People who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on."" I'll never waste my time there again."  I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air."  check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town."  bamboo vases with baby's breath...if only I could replace my bedroom's Charlie's Angels motif for all this. But we were here for big sis. In those 25 plus years....Pier 1 hasn't changed that much. And that's cool. I just think they've gotten a little big for their britches and the prices are too high and don't match the quality of the product. A balsa wood nightstand? Hmmmm...not gonna work. But those cute little plates with the palm trees. Nice touch. And do you think you could jam anymore into this space? Word of caution to future Pier 1 shoppers: limit your pre Pier 1shopping cocktails to only two. Otherwise you just bump into stuff. And break a lamp. Or something. So I heard." This particular location of Pier 1 has a really friendly and helpful staff. When I went a little overboard (spent too much) on a recent trip and brought about half of the stuff back to return  International Massage Practitioner" Be sure and see Chris or Tanner!  They know their stuff."  but has good sales  including clearance.  I've found reasonably priced decorator pillows in colors I can't find elsewhere.  It's also a good place for unique dinnerware; I found some killer retro dinner plates bowls and small plates.  Staff runs from helpful to pushy at times."  goes to grab the toilet paper and literally slices the tip of her finger off! The manager and sales associates showed little to no concern. This incident required immediate emergency services! Not happy at all with this location!" I love Cost Plus. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it tends to be a little expesive and this definitely stands for the furniture. I love the food section though! They have decent posters too...  and a large selection of beers and wines. I never get what I came for and leave because there's always a great deal or item you don't think you can live without."  give yourself some time and walk down each aisle.  It can be amazing the things you find hidden in the shelves that you might have missed if you just scanned down from the end.  And wear comfortable shoes - you might be there awhile."  there's a place that earned my repeat business!" Why not add some global influences to your decorating style?"  the little trial sizes of random gourmet foods (a mini bottle of aged balsamic? so cute!) and one of my favorite wines was discovered here first. Norton's Malbec. It's $8 and fabulous. They also have a ""reserva"" for like $14 but the cheaper one is a better ""bang for your buck.""" "DAMN YOU COST PLUS. DAMN YOU! Why oh why did we stop by after a Ticoz happy hour? Do you realize how vulnerable I am after two pineapple mojitos? Do you realize what I can do with two empty shopping carts  is the parking arrangement and it is not easy to get into its' parking lot.... I think the prices here ae better than Pier One....By far!" I call the style of this store ""funky urban"".  I prefer it over Pier 1."  I prefer it to Pier 1 or other stores like it."  they also have an *amazing* candy selection! If you are a fan of imported candy Found a ton of things for stocking stuffs...  I am coming back soon to get some xmas shopping done."  and more bar glasses then I need. My Bf hated me when i came home with a world market bag. Then I would pull out a a beer sampler for him and a bottle of wine for me "If you been to one anywhere in the USA you have seen all the WorldMarket Stores. I have been to them from Santa Fe to Seattle to Phoenix and many  suburbs in between. It's all the same! Over priced merchadise & art that is mass produced supposedly in other parts of the world. Groceries/beer/ wine once difficult to locate. Now its rather mondane and lacking a thrill. Narrow oddly arranged rows where you are bond to knock something over. Still people come and buy  but I rarely find anything to buy."  they have a huge variety of everything you might want to decroate your home with or eat off of.  Thank you Cost Plus and the fantastic employees." They carry a lot of stuff from around the world which is awesome lot's of foods and collectables.  They have all sorts of interior decorative products If you try just these 3 things you will glimpse nirvana!" Did I mention that I love this store?"  courtesy of this guy who acts like a 12 year old."  love this place! If I had lots of money to spend I would have my whole house done in world market products! All their products are so unique! The layout is very nice and the people are super friendly and helpful! I just have to say it once more I love this place and could spend hours here." It really is a World Market and you won't leave without buying a lot more than you anticipated." Looking for some eclectic lamps? Interesting wines? Fun throw pillows? Glasses? Snacks? Go to ""The Happy Place""!!!!" My only gripe would be that when they send out a 50% off one item coupon...they should at least have something in their store that is not on sale so I could use the damn thing!  The coupons are for regular priced items and EVERYTHING was on sale!  Bummer." This location can be hard to get in and out of the parking lot.  Employees are friendly and helpful.  Love it that they let me come back for a credit when I forgot my birthday coupon.  you're going to go in with a list and walk out with everything you were looking for and then some. If you ever get the chance This happened in the beginning of the year. There was a small couch on clearance. I liked the size and color and it was comfortable to sit on. I noticed there was no sales tag. There was a sign that said clearance . I asked the sales person how much it would be for this small couch. I ended up waiting forever to have my question answered. About 45 min or so. She finally comes out and tells me what the price was. It' was a reasonable price. Then I noticed there was a black stain on the seat of the couch. It's pretty noticeable when sitting on the couch.  I pointed it out and said to the sales person what I had found. No comment coming from her. She just stares at it. I asked the sales person if there is another couch for sale or not for sale. There was none left in that style that I liked. I was surprised that they would have a dirty stained couch on their floor. I left and went else where. I hope they change managers there. That place has changed. It use to be a fun place to go to with good sale people. Now they seem to be so disorganized and sloppy in their work.  and chocolates at decent prices. Also a good place to go if you need to find a gift for someone but you're not sure what to get."  very unique! It's definitely one of my favorite stores! Sales & coupons are always a bonus!"  The staff at this location is always helpful and gracious. If you need a price look up they have pricing guns at the ready to scan items for you. The clearance section always gets me since those treasures are deeply discounted but you have to get there when the fresh stuff is put out or it's slim pickings. This location is right off of  HWY 51 so getting off at Highland while going North and driving through the little Mall area is my short cut to get here. I love World Market because you can spend all day here and never see everything; but you always find just what you need." What a snooty store. I was followed around the whole time and asked if I was ready to ring up when I wasn't even at a register. Didn't have the bag of violet crumble that I was looking for. No need to come back. u8bQvtkVa5lW-SNwRLH6Vg They greet me when I arrive and the manager is very nice; always looking out for the customer."  and well stocked.  The staff is friendly and acomadating and you can always find various sales. If you have never been to Cost Plus Market With great customer service (they've offered to call me and hold a minor $6 grocery item) "This is a swell spot.  I love to go through here and look at the various things! I love the ethnic items and the housewares that they have.  For a little bit you can get a nice look for a dinner party or gift.  I really like the various food items that are from other areas of the US and globe.  A lot of fun just to go through the aisles and see things that you may have remembered from your grandparents or childhood. Many nostalgic feelings on many items.  I really love the assorted bowls  and they back it with great products and a great wine selection.  You won't find a $100 bottle here I really enjoy all the options that the store provides Too bad because I love this store." The jewelry is constantly updated with new and beautiful items "Copenhagen rocks. I had the pleasure of stopping by the store about a dozen or so times over the past few weeks to redo my entryway and living room  and they still sell the Newton model there today.  I was wanting something a bit different that they didn't have in stock.  I priced it at the Denmarket and then checked online.  I had spoken with the manager Mary at the time of my pricing.  I looked online and found it cheaper through an online competitor.  Due to the economy I figured I would give Copenhagen the opportunity to compete.  I mentioned the price the competitor was giving and the free shipping and Mary had given me 10% off with free shipping to match the competitor.  She told me it would take about 4-6 weeks for my special order that I wanted and it was just a couple days over.  The furniture delivery occurred today  they custom ordered our couches from Italy (we picked the heavier material and the color)..." We will shop here first for all of our home furnishings!"  central Phoenix to north Scottsdale and even online then finally we found a wonderful collection of comfy great made furniture.  We had specifics and yes our taste comes into play which is why I was hesitant about going to Copenhagen. I really had in mind that Copenhagen was going to be overly priced and way too modern for my taste.  I was wrong.  It definitely is modern but they offer pieces that have a great balance with modern and semi traditional.  Their leather choices are fantastic from color to grade.  On top of that  and the overall company that people of color's money is just as good as Caucasian's. Perhaps this store would benefit from ""Sensitivity & Diversity"" training.  It is so rude to not welcome EVERYONE to your store The Camelback Copenhagen store is the only one I can recommend. The ones in Tempe and Scottsdale were extremely disappointing. The sales people at those stores ignored me the entire time and were too busy chatting among themselves. At least in the Camelback store the sales people offered assistance and were willing to explain some of the design features of the furniture. I will definitely shop again at the Camelback store.  but this experience has not only ruined my family plans for Thanksgiving but has me searching again for a new table and chairs. The lack of any contact from Copenhagen has been most frustrating "I think half our furniture in our house is from Copenhagen. Great style innovative designs and very contemporary. Always adds as a center piece on each room. The one set back is the quality of materials have seem to have declined over the years. Majority use to be solid wood I didn't feel pressured at any point and everyone was very polite.  While I didn't buy anything today there is a strong chance I'll be going back here often in the future."  this one of the few places in AZ that you can get it." "I love this store. It's always a fun treat when I find myself with the time to stop in. The sales staff are super friendly and not at all pushy. They have a wide selection of quality Get on their mailing list for their annual (or semi-annual) warehouse sale. I've found some good stuff there with slight wear or needing just minor reconditioning." Don't judge a book by its cover In any event like I said if you want cheap stuff and can deal with the tumbleweeds and dust balls blowing across the isle the venomous packs of cockroach rats and non English speaking staff then Big Lots is for you. On another note this is the best place to by cheap disposable holiday goods i.e. Halloween Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen  but now that I know what they have to offer  that seemed reasonably priced. I never thought of Big Lots for patio furniture... So I shop around looking for discounted prices on items I usually buy elsewhere and am always happily surprised at what I find. Yup- I'll be back." "Big Lots is a Big Lots is a Big Lots.  Not sure why everyone was so disgusted by it  when you go here you end up buying things that you don't even want/need because you are certain that everything you buy is a deal." "I truly appreciate what this store has to offer customers. The staff is friendly and helpful and the store carries almost every item you could think of without looking ridiculous. The prices on most items are insanely low "It works.  I found some picture frames at a cheap price.  Yes they were dusty Terible costumer service from the manager! I found a set of pots and pans that clearly said it was on sale but the guy was a total jerk and refused to give me the discount.  but I'm able to get what I need with ease." Go check it out.  And buy a little something for yourself."  Alas for me the merchandise is geared toward folks who have yet to develop a personal style. Very generic in design for the most part. So this might be why it is so serene i won't be returning." I love this place. They have such nice stuff. I like to just go and look at everything they have. Since I cant afford most of it. "The customer service at this Pottery Barn is above and beyond the rest. I recently got married and we were registered at Pottery Barn which meant we frequented Pottery Barn often. The staff has always been nothing but friendly and extremely helpful. I find that it's much easier going into the store with questions instead of calling the 1-800 number and I have yet to be unsatisfied with this location. The sales associate I am tackling the daunting task of furnishing a new home and Liz and Ashley at the Camelback Store have both been very helpful in helping me make decisions. The best customer service. Highly Recommend this store." One of my favorite decor stores. The store has such a great atmosphere and love going around holidays to get decorating ideas. Staff is always very helpful. They have great classes that they offer and if you attend you get 10% off that day. They also offer free in home design consultations if you need ideas and help with your home. The prices were very reasonable" I had a great experience today Greg the sales associate was amazing very helpful and extremely courteous. He went above and beyond what I had ever imagined I'm now a loyal customer of Biltmore Pottery Barn and will tell everyone to ask for Greg!! All of can say is they are rude !! I had to pull teeth to have someone to help us...and then when she rang us up she didn't say a word and No thank you for shopping nothing... I love the store But hate the service I think she needs to be called on the carpet for treating a customer like a child.  Scold scold scold!  Yes  again. Peace out Pottery Barn." "Horrible customer service. As a young adult I felt that I was ignored by staff. A employee in greeting range  after it sells.  It's like a higher end garage sale.... you can find some really great stuff.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to sell there nicer stuff and get meaningful money back."  so I imagine their stock changes constantly. You're going to be paying higher prices than you would at garage sales or thrift stores The other thing that gets me is that they have 4 locations. This sucks. If your consignment I really don't want to shop four stores in three parts of the valley in for things. This is one time a large location like UFO on 16th  got it right  not the intake counter) on the Arizona Humane Society. I don't think any percentage of their proceeds actually go to the Humane Society. Another redeeming aspect  an older employee (possibly the store manager) said that he was NOT interested in the table.  I showed him my photos and pointed out the individual who had told me to deliver the table.  He basically said ""too bad"" and good bye.  I will never again attempt to utilize the ""services"" of My Sister's Attic."  and no one has ever acknowledged my existence. It seems like a lot of super dated pieces... thrift store finds at boutique prices. I've not ever enjoyed my experience there Thank you for your existence!!" dLBqf9QayF9eSUzz6BvmSQ  if you're looking. Customer service was good Ed some of my friends and neighbors to see if I was over reacting and all of them said the same thing. It was and is not a good business practice.  I will not be shopping there again.  I would have if they had just said ""no"" because I blew it by not measuring.  But taking advantage of a customer is to me is just ""unethical""" "If you are thinking of dropping off your items at this store DON'T DO IT! I had placed the same items on craigslist for seven pieces four of which were hand carved mango wood pieces. MSA priced the pieces at fire sale prices and when I received calls from people that really wanted the furniture at my prices Quality furniture and design pieces which are mostly worth the higher consignment pricing. Friendly staff! 8) Several weeks have passed. I have not heard a word.  I sent my saga to corporate twice and they never responded either."  I checked out a few other places on my quest for a new mattress before ending up at Bedmart. Should've just come here first. They've got a wide selection (a few actual beds Mattress purchasing is so insanely subjective that I wouldn't dissuade you from shopping at Bedmart; I'm sure someone else could find a bed they love and use for years there.  My own experience is that I wasted $800 with no recourse." No tossing and turning tonight !" Worst customer service experience ever!! I was looking for a mattress for my son and i told the guy I was just looking and he threw a fit and yelled at the other employee that i wasn't serious about buying a mattress and stormed away. I will never go back or suggest anyone to spend money in there  they were actually quite rude. They refused to take the bed back. I didn't even have it for 24 hours. If you see a good review on here it's probably from one of their employees. Just to let you know." We went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it I would not recomend this shop." Bedmart is a sleazy company.   Dishonest...   Pricing is horrible.   They try to rip you off...then start dropping the price when you show them that they are as twice as expensive as Ashley Furniture and Mega Furniture!!!!  For the exact same Simmons sleep set!!!!   Keep 1 hand on your money if you deal with this sleazy company. "I agree with the 0 star rating. Ordered box spring for Cal King and received Regular king box spring instead.  It's their mistake but would not admit and charging another delivery fee to come pick them up. It is insane! Nothing is written as return policy.  I thought about exchanging but now  I told the salesman that I wanted a price on a specific I Comfort mattress. I gave him the model name and size I wanted and was told they did not have that mattress in stock yet. I was then passed off to the manager who went to their computer and told me he found the mattress and it would be $1799.00 and that they had the exact same the mattress  and a jillion inviting pillows.  I sat in the corner of the sectional; then stretched out fully to ensure it was the right fit--It was perfect.  When I pulled myself up  you will never lack for a sales associate none the less. There is a huge array of furniture for the whole house; yet I have never found anything I would consider buying. This is not to say the furniture is bad We're pretty happy with the furniture (a beautiful set the quality of the furniture is good and the prices range depending on which gallery you look in I don't know why I always shop around bc I know Pruitts will have the best price. I wish they had a better website.  it goes great wherever you go and it's sturdy enough to make it through a move  Pruitt's kept my $$$ for 7 weeks ... did nothing ... never called ... and lied when I called them ... repeatedly. So I made them give me my money back this morning. Save yourself time and trouble!! I didn't even buy one of the (many) cheap couches they have and they still treated me this way. Shop elsewhere! Oh ... and if you know somewhere I can buy a nice  I didn't expect to find much at this store but was encouraged by the mostly-positive reviews.  I had a particular sofa in mind which I'd seen at two Mor locations and pretty much had my heart set on finding it or something very similar.  Thankfully "My sofa was delivered as promised without any real issues.  The sofa had a medium dirt smudge on the side despite being delivered in plastic.  I was told the delivery team would call me when they were 30 minutes from my place but they showed up without a call.  Regardless Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though. will update when we actually get the furniture." If you are looking for nice furniture at a great price go here!"  the whole process took about 20 minutes and the salesman was awesome! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the couch wasn't available for SIX weeks...has to be ""made"" apparently. I don't like that I have to wait that long for something I was expecting to pick up within a week "I had a great salesman (Sam) who I could tell really cared about the customers. I felt bad because I had problems with the manufacturer  it seemed like the salesmen couldn't get me outta there fast enough when writing up my bill. But as for East Valley location...awesome furniture "I was so excited to go and look for new furniture for the house we are moving into until we met the salesman.  After looking around and putting our final decisions "Furniture is great and have used Pruitt's for over 10 years. We have purchased carpet twice from them and the first time we had shipping and production issues and had to be on cement floors for a month and finally I had to suggest us changing to a different color as it took that long for them to let me know what the issue was. We purchased carpet almost two years ago from them again on another home and I have had them out 3 times to re-stretch it  but are right there when you have a question or are ready to purchase. The delivery service is impeccable. They call you when they are on their way and the men delivering are courteous and professional. Several pieces of my furniture are from this store and they are very good quality and have weathered kids and pets." Great place to buy any piece of furniture. The sales folk don't hound you to death and I found the living room set I bought from Pruitt's for hundreds of dollars more in other stores. They have earned my business. 000 on furniture and mattresses and the customer service will not replace a defaulty mattress! The mattress has a 10 year warrenty and they still said it was not bad enough. It has to have 2 inches of wear down on the sides! IT is like sleeping on raw coils! Will not shop there again! We suggest Mesa TV and Appliance and they will order anything you want at a lower price!" Worst customer service ever." "Good prices but bad service.   I shopped and found a nice set for a good price.  I went home measured and ordered online in the morning on a Thursday.  Later on Thursday early evening I had not received a call.  I called the store and confirmed they received the order.   I had requested a Saturday morning delivery online.   The rep told me that usually they have a 4 day window for deliveries but he would do me a ""favor"" and schedule it for Saturday.   Are you JOKING?  The competitors all have next day delivery.   I had to be nice since I wanted the Sat. Delivery so I thanked him.  On Saturday morning I had not received a call.   I called and they said the store does not call "We ordered a black sofa bed from Pruitts Furniture about 4 weeks ago. Pruitt's never called to let us know that it had arrived. We called and they told us to go to the store (34th st and Thomas) to pay the balance and then to the warehouse (43rd ave and Washington) to pick up the couch. Got the couch home and it was brown. The sales person told us they would order the couch in black "I purchased a $2500 sectional from them. It was beautiful and I was in love the minutes I saw the carmel colored beauty. Within six months a peice of the frame came loose and pertruded through the fabric in the back. I called them and they sent someonne out to repair it. within  6 months it was broken again. They refused to fix it stating that it was outside of the year. I understand that placed have to set a time limit I should have listened to my gut feeling while I was purchasing the set and walked out. So if you end up in this awful place and you have a great desire to run. RUN!!!!"  and because our crappy couch is *extremely* comfortable The prices here are pretty good compared to other places! I'm not a wood expert either but I can say that the bedroom set we have seems sturdy and good quality. It looks so great!! The only gripe I have is that the prices for their ""bedroom sets"" seem lower than they really are because they only include the bed  great store and service! You are now my furniture. I went to Pruitts to look at  dining tables but my eyes betrayed me...they wandered to  look at a beautiful  and the delivery was on time with no complications.  We really love the new beds and sectional sofa.. Will definitely purchase from Pruitt's again.."  owners number or email address. They claimed they don't have that information! Ha! I looked up the manufacturer myself and called them... Had the answer is 5 minutes that I've been waiting on for over a week. These people are uninterested in helping once they have your money. We've purchased lots of items from them in the last 10 years and their quality has gone way down as has their respect for the people who spend money there. Never again!! Please consider purchasing from another store who will care to treat their long time or any  customers well."  I was not sure what I wanted.  I need to go back and take my time to review everything.  Just a run through  but they have the worst customer service on the planet. One of my pieces was defective and the process to exchange it and get a new one was horrible. they make you wait all day again to get the piece...not one but 3 times. once to confirm it's messed up The only hitch was experienced was the delivery.  They could not get the sofa into the room.  This problem had been discussed prior to the purchase.  The old LazyBoy that came out of that room had to have the bottom frame removed in order to get it in and out.  The delivery guys said they did not do that type of work So - we walked out.  And I decided even if I couldn't find that sofa elsewhere Needless to say we went elsewhere."  nor would I recommend my friends to go here either." I ended up having a handle on my dresser break and the service to get a replacement was zero. They didn't return my call when looking into this request and when i called back Worth a look if you're furniture shopping."  and nobody is pushing sales on you like other furniture stores.  The shipping was awesome!  You have to call at 9am the day your items are to be delivered.  They will then tell you what stop you are and an approximate window As I write this it's 10pm on Saturday  and I actually will come back to them since I'm furnishing my new house. I would recommend them for anyone looking for great prices and quality. A hint for yelpers out there: Ask for Ken (sales)  but I wasn't ready so I decided to wait. I received a call on Sunday confirming a Monday deliver and also a call on Monday morning when the truck was about 15 minutes away. I really couldn't ask for much more In a furniture buying experience. Next time I need to purchase furniture A word about the delivery - it is a third party company that they hire and Pruitt's has no control over their delivery abilities or schedule! I was able to get my couch delivered the following day I have shopped at Pruitts quite a few times now. Each time I have been the salespersons have never been pushy. They have a HUGE selection of furniture. It's almost impossible not to find something there. If you are looking for any type of furntire.. Pruitts is the place to check first.  instead of visiting four other furniture stores. We found a fantastic sectional there for a price that was about half of what other furniture stores were offering. We bought it  professional and I didn't feel pressured at all. I'm actually looking forward to going back and finding some accent pieces soon." All-in-all it was a very good experience."  is the best!! The wrong mattress was delivered from a misunderstanding between me and the sales person.  I was not clean in what I wanted (yes I went over the entire conversation in my head and spotted my error).  I called Pam and explained the situation.  She had the correct mattress delivered the next day.  The delivery guys noted I had a low profile box spring but a high profile was sent with the new mattress.  They took the time to explain why I may want to keep the low profile box spring and showed me the difference.  This was exceptional service!  They really did a great job in keeping me happy and sleeping well in deed!  Hats off to Pruitt's and Pam!"  something got messed up & it couldn't be delivered until a later date which wouldn't work for us.  I went back in and Bill really helped me out (he worked with us the first time too) and I found a new furniture set that we loved a million times more than the one we initially picked out!  Bill went out of his way to help us get the furniture in time for my family to visit!  He was great & anyone that goes in should ask for him!  We are in LOVE with our new couch and love seat!  It's huge Don't shop here......"  and the salesman I spoke to there was able to order the table for me IMMEDIATELY. I don't know if their sales staff makes commission or not I was unimpressed by this lazy and rude customer service. But - if I could choose between friendly staff or a sofa for cents on the dollar "My most recent experience with Pruitts left me rather disappointed. My husband and I purchased a home and needed furnishings fast. I've shopped at Pruitts before and I was confident they'd provide excellent service. Our salesman was great. He was honest and truly wanted to help us get a good deal. I told him our budget and he was able to stay close to it. We encountered a problem with the billing team. We requested to do a split payment amongst two cards (one debit one credit). They did not follow our directions and debited we the entire $3000+ from our checking account  they followed me in every room. I decided on a couch so I left and shopped around the valley. Surprisingly they had the best price so I returned to buy it. They delivered it two days later and on time. The reason why I gave three stars is that when I went back to buy the couch they told me it was out of stock however they were going to give me the couch another customer had ordered  and the employees who assisted me with my selection were great!" This place is not what it used to be. My parents bought their furniture here and I came to check it out. They have a lot of options but it just feels like the store is old. Not for me. "Ordered a bedroom furniture set over a month ago. It was supposed to be delivered in a week. My salesperson never followed up to let me know that it wouldn't be arriving or delivered. I've had to follow up twice. Every time I call in  so when looking for a new living room set I knew I wanted to come back here.  Fell in love with a set and bought it immediately.  I was told that it was on back order and would be delivered around mid September at the latest.  Well its mid September....and I have heard nothing.  Today I call and Jessica (very nice) told me that it was due to be shipped the warehouse by October 5!!!  WHAT?!?!?!  That's over 2 more weeks with no couch. I have decided that this was a sign....RETURNING THE WHOLE SET!!  I am irritated and this was a 100% different experience than years ago.  Lesson learned....This will not be a stop for furniture ever again!  Very disappointing!!"  we needed to remove the bunk bed ladder. The men who installed it threaded the screws terribly and completely stripped them and we literally cannot get the ladder off to put the mattress and support board in. This is the crappy service that just keeps on keeping on long after you place your furniture order. I will never make another purchase at Pruitt's again no matter how cheap their furniture is. You get what you pay for." My only complaint is when we got the pieces unwrapped I discovered I was missing one set of the feet to my couch. I called the store and they told me the warehouse only had brown feet available and I needed black Then my phone rings and it's the previous man calling back...again.  I told him how I just got off the phone with Pam who also verified the 88 they have in stock.  I asked him if he's given thought to how many other customers they have lost business to when they're told items are no longer in stock and they have plenty?  I told him how his customer service was horrible since he wanted to argue about the information I had given him (that was correct).  He still wanted to argue.  I never got his name "We recently spent a few days looking around phoenix for some new furniture. We needed a few basics for our new place and decided to go with Pruitt's being that the prices were great and they have so many options. We ended up with a living room set We got a queen size bed with no problem! They come and set up the bed for 68.00...GREAT PRICE! Thanks Pruit's Totally different experience. They changed my perception of them. Very good experience."  even better so we purchased it. When it got delivered this sofa set up was reversed so the extra piece was on opposite side making it to long. So when I'm back at the store they told me the charcoal only comes with the insert on left the original tan we picked out only comes with insert on right side Wichita is why we picked it out. Sales person never mentioned it. Here's the kicker pruitt's will reorder it but charge us another delivery fee. So much for customer service. I'll be getting the rest of my furniture for the new home somewhere else." Don't bother going anywhere but here.  Low pressure sales people.  Massive store with tons of things to look at.  The clearance section is full of amazing deals.  If you go in the morning?  You can usually get same day delivery.  The furniture is high quality and I have never had an issue with any items purchased.  When they deliver?  They are quick and painless. "I want to give my highest recommendation for Pruitt's and a very fine and excellent employee Nora who works there.  They have outstanding customer service.  Nora went out of her way to do everything she could to professionally and kindly accommodate and assist me.  I have never seen a furniture store do so much to make sure a customer was satisfied.  I have purchased from Pruitt's in the past and their furniture is good and it lasts  and awesome prices. If you can ask for Ken - he is so kind and very helpful. Small business that's been here for over 60 years!" Worth a visiting at least once every few months however!" Their selection of OLD items is great and their prices are decent. The staff is always really nice and they are open on Sundays This is hands down my favorite antique shop. I've been to most of the shops in phoenix and this one always stands out to me. I always seem to find something that I have to have wether it be some old black and white photos or a bear rug! The staff is friendly and will help you find what your looking for if you require something specific. They will also call the booth owner if you would like to make an offer on a piece. Everything is reasonably priced for the most part and the content stays filtered. I mean I have nothing against people who collect toys and beetles memorabilia but I'm just glad that at this store I don't have to sift through it.  2 thumbs up for sure! 9ryGi1IxglgxuZEmfDQfAg  but someone will help if you ask. It's like any other store...some prices are more than fair and some are very high. You don't find much junk here...it goes from high end glass items to collectibles of any price. It's true about being watched Great place to fine unique pieces of furniture. I bought 3 end tables and an english Edwardian desk from them and I'll go more and look for other stuff. The elegant lady with the short black hair in the front is very nice and she will do anything to help. Thank you ! 9XmZiDDXs7OPLyaDz4Z4Vg "I love this store! I have been to most of the antique shops in Phoenix and out of all of them this place is my favorite. The best thing about it is that it is somewhat regulated as to what is sold there. No plastic 80's/90's toys  I've started to add this place to one of my favorites. The staff always is always nice to me and I've found quite a few fantastic pieces for my house. The prices seem reasonable and there's a couple booths that always have something fun to look at." Major negative: it's exceedingly more expensive than other antique shops in the valley."  weird wall hangings to furniture that you can't sit on unless you buy (makes sense). One can easily spend hours  & right away a lady showed me afew pieces around the store.  Ive purchased a few items from here love browsing around the store"  they don't know you from Adam. Anybody that is going to get they're feelings hurt about it might need to stay home and shop on eBay. Just sayin'. Having said all that Bottom Line: Do your self a favor and don't stop by here."  I felt I needed to come in and defend my staff.  A few weeks ago a one star review was left by a young lady named Bianca.  I plan to address her concerns privately The gals at the counter always greet us and never hover.  Last time I was fortunate enough to make an offer on 3 items from the same dealer and got 20% off because of it!  Thank you Pat!"  but I stated we would not be returning and would spend our money elsewhere.  She retorted  ""that's fine!""  what happened to good customer service? If she would have been polite it would have been a totally different experience and we probably would've returned... Not the case!  With this economy customers have many choices of where to spend or in this case NOT spend their money. We will never go back to this establishment!"  in general are pleasant & helpful.  Of course you can expect them to ""check on you""...every store does that. I don't take offense.   I purchased a big item that had to be delivered and the staff could not have been nicer & more helpful.  Thanks!" "Cave Creek between Cortez and Cactus is a great place for antique hounds.  There is a plaza filled with antique malls from one end to the other.  The largest of the shops is ""Everything Goes."" It occupies 3 storefronts on the south end of the plaza.  Like a lot of other shops  but good stuff for your home I'd highly recommend it.  Very friendly owner and staff.  Keep your eyes peeled and you'll find great stuff!" -What happened to the antiques and vintage stuff? I saw MORE modern day stuff than old stuff. Wasn" I highly recommend this place is you are looking for treasures! :)" I love shopping at Everything Goes!! The people  are very friendly and willing to help you find just the right thing for your house:) They have a wonderful selection of vintage furniture and just the right decorating pieces! I couldn't fit a piece of furniture in my car and they were nice enough to deliver it to my house. "Very fun little vintage shop.  You never know what you will find here.  There are quite a few vendors who bring in a wide range of merchandise.  I have purchased a beautiful antique console "I have been going to this store for years and its one of my favorite places to go.  There is always and eclectic array of furniture  most vendors have excellent prices. Lots of fun shops in this little strip mall. This will be my go-to location from now on!" In the past I've gotten glassware and a Kimble painting- very reasonably priced!!"  the staff is so friendly and nice but not in an annoying paid-on-commission-way- but in a we-love-our-store-and-what-we-sell kind of way. This place is nestled within a few antique stores but Everything Goes is by far the best. It can be overwhelming since there is a lot of stuff but try to focus on one thing at a time. Also Love this place and always find something to bring home. The people here are the friendliest and most helpful salespeople around. They know where everything is and dig out stuff from the back if they think they can help you. Love the selection and the prices too. My daughter and I went shopping for a dresser for her room on Saturday and found a dresser at a furniture store on Bell road but it was all scratched up and I told her we could shop again on Sunday. Then I thought to look it up on yelp and this place came up. It's a very cute store on cave Creek Road. It had alot of antique stuff. My daughter found a real az style dresser for $95 plus tax. The owner was so helpful and very fast in getting the dresser ready for me to load it in my SUV.We did this in a matter of 20 minutes. I would recommend this place to everyone that is starting out and moving out for the first time.  but too big. Will definitely go back again. Prices within budget  then don't take in small items.  Perhaps spending ""money"" and investing in some sort of security tag protection would be a far better choice than losing customers you've made feel uncomfortable.  I guarantee you've lost ALOT of business simply by the way you make others feel following them around.  It's just not a nice thing to do to someone!  Other than that "This is fun to wander around and follows the model of having cubbies that folks rent to sell their wares.  That means you'll find an endless of amount of anything and everything.  If you're into vintage/retro What a wonderful shop!  The owners and their staff were welcoming and helpful!  So many cute and well priced items!  I will definitely be going back to find more treasures!  same as any other Big Lots.  They all seem pretty consistent.  Bit of a ""desperation & despair"" feeling in there from the employees and clientele Cheap.. Hit or miss but cmon.. It's that kind of store . Always have the dog bagels that my pup has to have.. People are friendly.. I have never been to this location before. I used to go to the 1 on 67th ave & Cactus because it was in the same complex as my hubby's office & I would have to pick him up sometimes. I went there so much I would buy shit I didn't need so I stopped that habbit & haven't been to 1 for like 3 years or so. Well this trip was not a cheap 1 like I had hoped. We saw tons of cool lights & decorations for the house & ended up spending $130 all on Christmas stuff! I don't think I would have come here just to shop randomly though  but this one was a pleasant surprise.  I will drive out of my way to go to this store.  I hope they keep it nice.  I never know when I may need some fabuloso or some other random stuff." "Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots  now that's what i'm talking about. I've been to the stores in Tempe and Scottsdale. I prefer the Scottsdale location because it seems to have more variety  and tacky decor galore. Plus one time my roommate bought a whole box of beer shampoo. Sadly there was no matching beer conditioner. We also used to do something called Adventure Snacking where we'd go to Big Lots or the local dollar store and buy the weirdest edible things we could find. We're still alive  but not a bad stop off if you are in the area already!" 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH" Love this Big Lot store. Have been to many others and this one is staffed with friendly people and have a great selection. Good job guys! Been shopping here for years. Weird they switched location space. It's good still. Excellent service and some workers have been there for years. Thanks for the service. Stocking was great. Not rushed towards end of working hours. Thanks. 000 and more. Don't let these furniture places try and tell you how great their stuff is and why they are justified charging three times as much. If you pay attention to what you're buying Been shopping here for years. Weird they switched location space. It's good still. Excellent device and some riders have been there for years. Thanks for the service. Stocking was great. Not rushed towards end of working hours. Thanks. One catch -- no returns or refunds."  I feel comfort in knowing that I stumbled upon one of Phoenix's bargain gems. Once I buy that new mansion The claim is this is model home staging furniture to be cleared out.  Until my home is furnished Furniture Affair is awesome! They have a great variety of affordable furniture and accessories that you don't see everywhere else. I am buying a second home in Phoenix and had been all over town looking for furniture. This was my last stop! The quality of the furniture and the choices are fantastic! I am decorating the house in modern/rustic/urban and I found all I needed here! Thank you Thank you Thank you Jon for dragging furniture next to other furniture to see if it fit with my design. I couldnt have asked for better staff was disappointed that several slightly used pieces i was looking at actually cost more than buying the same item completely new!! thank goodness for smart phones and being able to research things on the spot!! hopefully more consumers start doing that at places like this.  the colors and style weren't what I was looking for (not their fault).  Definitely worth a stop if looking for furnishings or accessories.  They had unique pieces that could definitely be a conversation starter and many quality pieces that would last much longer than furniture found in lower-end furniture stores that are so prevalent throughout the valley." Furniture Affair is the best store to pick up high end furniture for half the cost. There are a lot of items to look at and it can be overwhelming because the some of the items are heavily used.  I have picked up beautiful artificial plants and trees for the home . I probably saved over 300.00. "This place has a huge selection for furniture and accessories from model homes. It's a great place to look for unique items for your home. There are some high end pieces for a great price but don't assume that the prices are always the best. I have seen pieces that were priced higher here than I paid for the identical new items. Also "Great selection of model home furniture.  Arranged in very fashionable settings.  Pieces to match any budget "Love coming back here to look for new treasures. They have everything from formal dinning sets (a recent purchase of mine) to lamps I rated it a five-star because of their customer service. They were willing to come down on the price and were careful in loading my husband's car. It's a store that you may not always find what you are looking for the first time Come support local business and check this place out!" I called several consignment places to try to sell my furniture.  I ended up choosing furniture affair because of the fairness of what they pay you on and the quick responsiveness of jennifer.  I was able to sell most of my stuff through friends however furniture affair was willing to take what I had left and recommend a mover who was cheap and efficient and price my stuff at a fair price.  Looking forward to getting the last of my stuff sold. "This place is a hidden treasure in phoenix. Get ready to spend some quality time here looking around I love this store. They have really nice quality furniture for a good price. You can definitely find cheaper furniture at places such as living spaces and American furniture warehouse but this is definitely higher end. They are nice enough staff. They have a section of used vintagey items and a section of new. Check it out of you are looking for new furniture! "Furniture Affair sells mostly furniture from model homes that have been closed. The place has all kinds of amazing deals. Ridiculously great prices on some really cool furniture and accessories. I found a beautiful dining table "Underwhelmed. I spoke with another woman who was shopping at the same time as I was and she said ""this place is weird."" Couldn't have said it better. The quality of the pieces was inconsistent and the prices about what you'd find at most major-name department stores. I didn't find the employees friendly or helpful at all."  I rate a one due to the fact that I just spent 1/2 hour looking around the store and not one of the employees chatting behind the counter said a single word to me.  Not even a hello when I came through the door!  It's Saturday and I'm refurnishing three rooms in my home!  I guess they don't really need or value customers  and mix and match until I found the perfect combination of pieces-and all at excellent prices.  Furniture Affair is an affair to remember; I will definitely return!"  you know we are having a moving sale right?"" Lol ok what exactly does that mean? Anyways didn't really see much but over priced run down furniture .. I came in looking for an ottoman saw two that were completely filthy anyways I wouldn't waste my time again."  I did not ask for either. I asked another employee if they knew how angry she was and they told me she was the owner and they hated working for her. No thanks Nancy. Your mostly dated goods can collect dust."  and helping me find just the right piece to complete my room."  the furniture looks like what you can buy everywhere and although the pricing is reasonable....you get what you pay for....cheap stuff made overseas.  They claim it's all ""from model homes""...maybe some of it still is....but I'm betting most of it is ""container"" shipments that many of the ""value"" stores carry.  The previous gigantic 'warehouse"" Furniture Affaire occupied on 7th St. had a feel of 'discovery""...this new location is just another (much smaller) storefront with run-of-the-mill furniture. Disappointed to see this change. While the employees remain helpful and pleasant  and might give you ideas.  But so far I haven't found anything that inspired me to plunk my money down.  Perhaps my house just isn't quite eclectic enough.  Definitely fun to look through though  but once in a while you can get lucky and find exactly what you are looking for at a reasonable price.  The owners are nice.  Unpretentious." "Drove by and decided to take a look. I did find two lamps that went with my master bedroom set quite nicely. Although i assumed that the price that was tagged were for both lamps We stumbled upon this place after checking out the used furniture store next door. They have a lot of great stuff! They're super helpful and friendly. We bought 5 pieces around 11am and they delivered them at 4pm the same day! Great prices too. Will definitely go back!  and some pretty cool wall art.  After we had fun looking at all the stuff and I mentioned I would have to be careful with my peacock because I was flying back to Vegas "What a wonderful store. The gentleman that was there was SUPER friendly and nice. The selection sure is Eclectic and I loved it. My budget is almost nothing  etc.  I bought a high end designer chair there for under $100.  I love it and I'm definitely putting this store on my rotation! :)"  Big Lots is like a sport.  The competition is how good a deal you can get.  If you're willing to take a sticky bottle They carried out the furniture and loaded it up and to top it all off we had a 20% off coupon for the whole order so cheap became damn cheap... sweet!"  and the have a furniture section to boot. Sign up for their email list and get the inside scoop on special deals and promotions." Give it a try! You may be surprised and your wallet will sure thank you!" Great customer service.  Great location." "I was really surprised at how much good stuff they had at Christmas. I was looking for gigantic bows and I found them there and more! The gal that stocks the place really takes pride to make sure everything is where it should be and knows it like the back of her hand. You ask "I love Big Lots! They have some great deals on food. We have a toddler and we get fruit pouches for a fraction of the cost here. Most of the products are not the best quality  did I mention that the stuff is cheap? There really shouldn't be any reason to lower the stars for a Big Lots being a Big Lots. I hate a lot of things  and it is in dire need of a remodel but you can tell they try. The staff is pleasant and the selection is good."  but the employees are very helpful and typically have great attitudes. There is always too much conditioner and too little shampoo Don't get me wrong his prices are decent I just wasn't impressed on the fact that he did the living social deal just to get people in the door.  I went home and contacted living social and they refunded my $$$ and said that if this is what he did then he broke his contract with them and these are not the businesses they want to work with.  Again decent prices just didn't like how this deal was handled." My Fiancee and I purchased a king mattress and box springs  from Steve Berdrow. Steve was fast and efficient and save me hundreds of dollars from similar mattress and springs at Costco. I would highly recommend Steve and R&S mattress for your mattress needs. "Steve was extremely helpful! He can help you find the right mattress for an awesome deal. Local company  but the door was locked and no staff to be found at 11am on a Tuesday. We waited for about 10 minutes and then left."  the customer service help we got from Colin Gree was incredible! Not only did he take the time to show us the different types of bedding but he tool the time to explain the ""quality"" differences and what would be best for us! Thanks for all of your help Colin  within seconds of walking in the door I knew I had made the right decision by going there. Colin Gee was really helpful in educating me on different types of mattresses and options as well as how R&S is able to offer such discounted prices for the exact same mattresses sold elsewhere for up to double the price. I never felt like I was being sold or pushed into buying anything. I felt great about my purchase and will without a doubt buy from R&S next time I need a mattress. Also "If you are looking for a new bed look no more just go down to r&s on bell and ask for the mattress ninja Colin Gee this guy knows what is going on. Not only did he not pressure me in to buying but when I said I had to leave and but would be back after work he didn't fret he actually handed me a 100 dollar pillow and said I will see you when you get back!!!! And he did "Bought a mattress and delivery was scheduled a week later. We changed our mind to cancel it next day itself but they won't cancel it even though delivery date is still few days later. Avoid this place Yesterday I purchased mattress here and slept on it last night!  I was saved after 5 nights of no sleep thanks to American Furniture's screw up.  Colin made sure I got my mattress home last night and I'm eternally grateful!  He knows a lot about mattresses! Check it out!!! Great priced and service. Collin is like.  Dealing with a friend of the family. This is the third purchase in 3 years. I would refer friends and family.Collin more than salesman  and not pushy but very informed . Did not have what I was looking for at bell and 40th store but shipped from other store no problem. If you need a good quality mattress  they immediately resolved the issue the same day. Would highly recommend them for the customer experience alone." We shopped at numerous stores and ended up buying  at R&S Mattress! We continue to be happy loyal customers buying another mattress online from R&S! Thanks for providing a comfortable nights sleep and a custom mattress to fit both our needs for two people that like different comfort levels!
