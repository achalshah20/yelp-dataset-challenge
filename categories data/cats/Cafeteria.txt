 it's extremely cozy down there. There are also microwaves (score!) haha!"  you can get to the caf through the tubes which is a godsend when the weather gets extremely cold. No need to venture outside. I tend to stick with the salad and sandwich bar. The hot bar seems ok The hot food is also just sub par. Nothing to write home about. I go there every couple weeks probably  spacious dining area make it a good place to talk shop or have some private time with someone. Two TVs for your viewing pleasure will let you enjoy a ""soap"" or catch up on the day's news. You may catch a KDKA personality or two passing through. It's worth the walk from anywhere in Downtown."
