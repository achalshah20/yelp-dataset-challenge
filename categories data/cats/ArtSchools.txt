I can't wait to go back!"  but even then there was a lot to see and the instructor upstairs was quite comfortable working in front of the public.  I'd go back  and also do a small class where I was able to make an ornament. The staff is always friendly and fun  and they offer lots of learning opportunities if you want to make your own glass art or functional glass pieces. Plus  but were severely let down by the make-it take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us  so there's lots to see and learn."  you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!"  I can't wait to pick mine up!  (It takes a few days.)  I definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date! My one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more HANDS ON than the glass blowing was."  must say that some of the prices for events are too high for most people to be able to afford going to the center very often. Maybe if they offered a Groupon or something like that. But  and (2) you have to wait three days to pick up your item so that it can cool properly. Obviously I look forward to going back here for another event or just to look around!"  so we are incredibly lucky to have one here. The equipment is maintained by a professional crew and the classes are taught by highly skilled and professional artists. This is definitely the best place you could think about having your first interaction with molten glass.. or if you're a professional artist moving to Pittsburgh.. well
