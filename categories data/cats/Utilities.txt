"Great place to work - a company that cares about its people. While most work is fast paced I also appreciate their social media involvement - they keep those Twitter feeds full of pertinent utility related information when a dangerous weather is a-brewing!"  I appreciate them sending out the free CFL bulbs." Their only job is to provide electricity to people and they can't even do that right.  The company is run by morons."  no ability to end my lease early since I am being robbed every month. I look forward to moving out of the area in 3 months and being a slave to LITERALLY ANY OTHER ELECTRIC COMPANY." "Had my power turned off because someone I live with didnt pay the bill like they said they would. So I call and it took 25 mins to get ""custmer service""  on the other end after their automated system dicked me over for 10 mins..Ended up paying  $220 and they tell me my power will be turned back on before midnight! I called at 3pm. 3 hours later I call back and it took 15 mins to talk to someone and they were effing rude to me. Other electric companys I've had Duke Energy shut off my power today for being late buy a tuna half weeks on payment that should have been setup an automatic. It's 2015 why can I not sign up for autopay online? And they can't guarantee it'll be on within an hour within an hour when the guy only left 30 minutes ago. Worst experience on the phone with customer service ever! If I can I will switch to florida power light immediately Scumbags with a monopoly on energy. They own your grid they sell your information they are one step away from owning you.
