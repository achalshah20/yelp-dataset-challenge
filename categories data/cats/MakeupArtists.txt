 wish I could get my face done more often!"  and then years later my entire wedding party.  I always walk out looking picture perfect.  I continue to frequent her to purchase custom blended foundation (as the other reviewer mention ) it is under $30 and it is a few ounces (maybe 2 fl oz) it last me just short of a year.  It is the best bargain out there.  No more wasting money on drugstore or department store brands that don't quite blend right or cost the same for only an ounce .  I also use Palmina mascara and loose powder." I am so happy with my make up consultation with Mary!  I am 57 years old and I can't believe the things I never knew about putting on make up correctly.  My make up lesson was so much more effective than any other consultations I have had at various high end make up counters.  Mary really knows her stuff and she helped me immeasurably because she really customized everything to focus just on me.  I highly recommend her to everyone - no matter what age.
