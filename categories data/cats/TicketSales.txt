Will definitely come back!" I called last min. for a baseball game and the owner wouldn't let the sales persone deal with me at all. He seamed like a very angery persone and you could hear him screamming at his employees over the phone. I made the situation very uncomfortable. When he finally got on the phone he told me to take it or leave it. I don't think that I would call or purchase from them again. I would not trust Danny Sharaby the owner of Tickets Unlimited. He jilted me out of my deposit on a condo that he rented.  He's not a honest person. The moral of the story? If they don't feel like you are worthy of the tickets- you may not get them. Save your time and energy and just get tickets somewhere else!!!" I dropped my Cardinals tickets off Sunday morning with the agreement of 70/30 split in my favor. They called me back an hour later and said they made a mistake and it would be 70/30 in their favor. REALLY???  I'd rather eat my tickets than do business with someone that doesn't keep their word. Seller beware.
