I am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy's service." "This awesome pharmacy is a throw back to the good ol days before the big box shops took over with their huge outlets and lack of personal service. I love CVP! They remember your name Have been using CVP since it opened in the 1970's. The service is fantastic and the people are outstanding. Since I moved to North Scottsdale it is not as convenient but I still would not use another Pharmacy!  I found Camelback Compounding Pharmacy in my own backyard! Wonderful and so helpful even on a Saturday!"
