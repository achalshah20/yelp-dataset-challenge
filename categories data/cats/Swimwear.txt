"I am a top heavy young woman and was reffered to this store for bathing suits. The girl who worked there was knowledgeable and helpful. There was only one suit I was interested in trying on. Unfortunatly  I arrived in Miami and it was time to hit the beach.  I put on my new suit.  It looked nothing like it did in the dressing room!  The bottom was WAY too loose!  What the heck!  The lighting must REALLY be off in that store I thought.  NOPE!  I looked at the label and the lady put a size 16 bottom in the bag instead of at size 10!!!!!!  Due to the personal nature of the product I cannot return it.  I am screwed.  AND  and am very happy with the fit and the price. The manager has a lot of skill and experience in fitting customers. I will definitely be back I went to a Everything But Water for the dreaded bathing suit shopping. Long are the days when every bathing suit fit me perfect  The sales lady was AWESOME. Explained how much swimsuits vary in size depending on the brand. Asked what my concerns were. Grabbed three suits that met those concerns. I left happy and ready for the beach. They have a return customer for sure!
