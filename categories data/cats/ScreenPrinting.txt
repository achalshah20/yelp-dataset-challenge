"Absolute worst customer service ever. I sent an email with my specs on 11/13 to James. He said he would work it up and get back to me. He never did. I followed up with him on 11/19 and he said he will work it up and have it to me by Friday 11/22. He immediately charged by credit card. Still no call or completion. I called up once again on Wedneday 11/27 and asked about the status. James was not in the office and called back on Monday 12/2 to find out nothing was done I'm not sure where I should start.  Maybe the fact that it took them three  weeks to get artwork to me.  Maybe I should start with that I was told I was being charged a $50 mark art work but was actually charged $550 for signs when I haven't even picked our the type of sign material I wanted yet.  Or maybe I should talk about how the owner did not accept any responsibility.  Or maybe I should talk about how they only completed half of the order and then completed the other half a week later and never bothered to tell me. Or maybe I should talk about the fact that we told me I could go **%* my mother.  Beside that I guess overall it was a pretty good experience. Had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago. My story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already. Incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service. I've used Realty Sign Co since 2009. They have have three convenient locations and they do a great job. They are helpful and will do their best to fill my crazy time requests like 75 open house signs in a week. :-) I recommend them to my realtor friends who many times are very demanding and they get the job done.  but having the warehouse right behind them makes them tell for help at each other
