"I started visiting this place in summer of 2008. Folks are always professional and friendly. I never feel rushed at this place. I've been working with Dr. David Drewitz and he always greets with a smile  I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later "I made my first visit here in November 2013. I found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. I was very happy with my visit with Dr. Mills. I can tell that he thinks critically about all the information I provide This place works with another doctor service (A2ZHome) and they made the appointment without any knowledge to my father (an 81 year old very sick man).  We got a nice little bill in the mail for $25 because we had no knowledge of this appointment only the robot call the day before that I then called the answering service and told them to leave a message that we would NOT be there.  My father was just to weak and sick to leave the home.  But I guess that doesn't matter.  I have been in the medical profession for 20 year and NEVER got a bill for a no show.  I guess they need lunch money.  Not quite sure how they are as doctors but I know they are not the ones we will ever see.
