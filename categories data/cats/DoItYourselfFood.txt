 leaving us with contact info and the assurance that we could call any time we needed help along the way. While I can't really speak to the fairness of the prices My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable! I stumbled into their Country Wines location in the North Hills and found out something that you might find useful- that location has a bigger bottle selection  we kinda looked around and found bulk size items and nothing that we really needed. It was the first time we've been to this location and I don't think there was any advertisement of offering specific amounts of grains
