 this is the place you want to go to. And if its your first time getting permanent cosmetic work done "I have been going to Elli for over ten years. She is simply the best at eyeliner. I usually go once a year and we laugh and talk about everything as she works Elli is great at her art. She does a good job and is very focused on detail. She is a good conversationalist and will keep you distracted. I got my eyebrows done today and it is a simple procedure.  Highly recommended place. Elli is amazing....she has done my eyebrows and eyeliner she is the best in Arizona..
