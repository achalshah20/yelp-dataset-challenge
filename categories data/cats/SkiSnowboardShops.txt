You may also get to have a good laugh if you too discover that the manufacturer had installed a right footbed in your left boot."  and outdated nature of this operation during that time.

"This store is home to all of the best big brands plus some smaller boutique-type brands for winter sports. Pricing is fair and reasonable.
