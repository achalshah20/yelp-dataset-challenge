Wishing you all the best on your own journey!" "This place is AMAZING. They welcome every human being. There was no judgment I am so happy to have found CLF." While my beliefs are different than them as I am Christian the attitudes and behaviors I have seen here are heads and shoulders above what I have experienced at many Christian Churches. I have attended on a regular basis and greatly enjoy my time and experience here on the Sundays that I am able to attend. They are open and accepting of all people. There are different lifestyle's that I don't necessarily agree with but it is not my place to judge but to treat with respect and dignity that each human being deserves. This is what I see here. Rev Michelle is a class act and a genuine caring person. Life is to short to condem others and that does not be occur here. Such a wonderful place. I have gone to CLF for years and it feels like home. Great people that care and very open environment. Great place for all backgrounds. It is a non-threatening place everyone can feel welcome. If your looking for a spiritual home this is it.  be sure to raise your hand b/c you'll get information about the Fellowship and the ""religion"" that includes a voucher for a free audio CD that explains more about this Fellowship."
