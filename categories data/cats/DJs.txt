 were subtle but present and definitely knew what they were doing. Contact and communication before the wedding was very good too. Definitely recommended - and our guests really liked the live music!" "I recently had my 21 birthday and booked Entertainment Unlimited to DJ at my party. I had talked to him we worked out types of music and a playlist that would best fit my party and it's theme. He got there on time and was set up before my party guests showed up. It was the best party I've ever had I would definitely recommend him for your event." "The company offered a game show type experience to a group of 150 people I hosted. They showed up on time "Hands down best wedding dj ever. We had Pj the Dj at my wedding this past weekend and could t be happier. April was a big help in booking and coordinating everything. She made the ""business part"" very easy and laid back. Answered all of our questions when needed within a reasonable amount of time. Pj fed off the crowd and kept the party going to the very end."
