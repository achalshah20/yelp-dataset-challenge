"I had some questions about my S Corp paperwork and Michael took a look. He explained what everything meant and which was like taking a Greek language lesson but understanding it immediately. He pointed out the important parts of the documents that were there and why they needed to be. He made some suggestions but was not pushy about additional services in anyway. I would highly suggest Michael for any and all Business Michael was great at getting our estate planning in order. Everything went smooth and very timely. I have a great sense of comfort knowing all our papers are in order. If I need anything else in the future I will certainly use Michael Tucker again. "We reconnected with Micheal after 15 years and it was a wonderful experience. We will be using him for all our estate planning and wills. We have an unusual family dynamic and he's is very receptive and understanding off all our needs. We felt very comfortable with him and his amazing staff from the beginning to the end of our time in his office
