0tHI0-PzdFW7b9z1AJ64HQ  you should!  Their prices are great for the quality and level of service they give."  I wouldn't take my clothes anywhere else!" "I can't thank Kachina cleaners enough for their amazing service!  They are always taking care of me from red wine stains to missing buttons to my rushes ""can I have it tomorrow?""  My clothes always look perfect & are always ready on-time. I trust them with anything that I need cleaned!  Thank you!" I will never go anywhere else - Kachina Cleaners is the absolute best! They kindly accommodated my last minute rush before a business trip and the owner (Stella I think?) is the sweetest woman ever. I went to a different dry cleaner in the area needing a tight turn around time and they wouldn't accommodate. Kachina did it without hesitation and everything turned out so nice.  it was $42. I am not sure if this is a good deal or not since I have never gotten something like this dry cleaned before. What I do know is that the first place I took them to wouldn't clean them  my sheets & towels are always clean & ready on time. If they are to be closed for holidays; they always have it posted & they verbally tell me as well."
