No go there if you love that person ..nice people but they have no knowledge how to take care of people ...if you love them fight to go somewhere other then here  caring and loving. They know what they are doing and do it well. The doctor she has been seeing has been very involved in her care and progress. He has great bedside manner and has not left any stone unturned with her. The staff has been friendly and welcoming to my family when we visit. I don't have a single regret about bringing my mom to Camelback. Today she can walk the entire facility. She looks forward to the therapy sessions and feels 200% better than she has in a very long time. The only draw back is the food is not all that great." There are some CNAs who are really good however the bad apples are the ones that give this supposedly five star facility a very bad reputation." Rude lazy people who don't care. If you complain your going to regret it!! Don't go call the state bored The biggest complaint I have is that they sent my family member home with no warning (alone)."  and most of them are not even equipped to handle people who might be disabled or handicapped. They hadn't even mentioned anything about breakfast when my family member finally decided she was getting out of there the morning after her one night stay. It was so noisy too and smelled like animals! DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
