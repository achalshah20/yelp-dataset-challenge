For the best in gear and supplies for Paintball & Airsoft go here!" The store is clean and well organized.  This will be our go to spot for all paintball." First of a all I would like to say I live about 45 min away.  The owner is laidback and a really honest guy.  He fixed my sons gun while I waited and charged me $8. I was quoted $20+ at another shop. I'm sure it was not anything big but I know nothing about paintball or paintball guns so honesty is greatly appreciated.  incredibly knowledgeable and the prices are always fair. The fact that they have been here for nearly 12 years says it all - no matter where you are in the valley this place is worth traveling for."
