So I called reynold's and within half an hour my car was safely in my apt complex's parking garage. The tow guy was also super helpful and courteous." Please avoid this company at all costs. I have had experience with much more helpful companies in the Urbana-Champaign area."  and polite. After all the reviews here and on google seems that if you call them you  the Reynolds worker smiled and asked him if he recognized her.  She was the manager on duty at Papa John's when his scooter was towed.  Shame on you Reynolds for towing poor college students from an establishment they are patronizing so you can make more money." "This place is absolutely terrible. I paid 240 dollars to get my car back and had to wait a half hour for them to even let me get to my car. On top of that these people are condescending assholes. Do not use these people  was not only hilarious but very polite and efficient as well. Great guy!"
