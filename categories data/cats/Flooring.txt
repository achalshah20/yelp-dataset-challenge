 I highly recommend this place. We will definitely be going back there again when we save up enough money  and find enough time to tile our kitchen floor."  and they were in and out without trying to force a sale on me.  I liked this so my husband and I met with them on a Sunday in their shop (they opened to accomodate us) and they were friendly and honest from the get go.  They told us that we could probably find a cheaper alternative but the quality and service most likely wouldn't compare to theirs.  They said they aren't the cheapest but definitely not the most expensive.  They have a wide range of styles and price options available.  Once we placed our order Thank you Tom and Christine! It was a pleasure to meet you :)" "This place is amazing! They recently installed laminate floors in our house and the service was exceptional from the moment I walked into their store. The lady working their was extremely friendly and very helpful. The owners are very easy to work and professional. I changed my mind several times throughout the project and they continued to support the changes with a smile. George
