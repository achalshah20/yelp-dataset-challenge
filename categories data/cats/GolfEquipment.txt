Every time I've been to Jerry's shop I've found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.  This little shop is a hidden gem for those of us who loose many balls in a few rounds of golf.  and Titleist balls have been used but not abused. Cheap" You'll also find good deals on nice used clubs. The re-gripping service is dirt cheap. But golf balls are bread-and-butter here and this place does it as well as anyone else. Quality is so far above the packaged used golf balls you'll find at target and sporting goods stores." Jerry's is great. You will always find what you want and the prices can not be beaten. These golf balls are like new!!!!! "I rarely write reviews... I honestly only remember the bad and never really the good.  I have been to Jerry's 2 times in the past 2 months.  Both times I have worked with the lady behind the counter.  I can't begin to describe how helpful and the level of customer service this lady has.  I will never go anywhere else.  She is extremely kind to not only me Only place I use to buy golf balls. Great service and awesome prices....can't ask for anything more. Customer forever.  Jerry replaced it for $40 and it even had a top grip on it and was another manufacturer's shaft that I probably would've paid 3x that at another valley golf shop. I can't find a better place to purchase and service golf equipment. I go back to Jerry's Golf Balls always before looking at area competitors as I know I won't find better services or prices... period." Great prices on used golf balls. Horrible hours of operation. It's like they don't need customers. I will find another place.
