***I've noticed that recently they've added sushi to the menu...hmmm." lHKS896yFkmAuWyFnbNP3A Note they are closed Fri night and sat afternoons."  and fast. Nice staff and both bottled and fountain drinks are available." Can't wait to try their other items on the menu!"  but it has all been very good.  The ""garlic knots"" a MUST.  The staff is super cool and very nice as well.  The complete dining experience.  I can't wait to get back there soon." I'm from the midwest. I'm picky about pizza. King Solomon's for the win." Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice Thank you King Solomon's Pizza!  Yum!"  but we've never been in. Let me say that I am so glad we corrected our mistake. We stopped in to order the 14' cheese pizza and it was wonderful!  It was as close to pizza from NY without going to the NYC. They also have a great 2 pizza slice and drink lunch special." The friendliness of the staff is hit or miss. Arturo is amazing and wonderful."  but I can't complain one bit.  They know how to make good pizza and it's fun to go with a group of friends without having your Kosher-observant friend feeling left out." This is a great casual pizza place.  We really enjoyed our cheese pizza. "Excellent pizza!  I ordered a 14"" cheese pizza from the counter The best pizza I've had in my entire life!!!
