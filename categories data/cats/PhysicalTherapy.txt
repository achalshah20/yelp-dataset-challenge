I'm still having residual problems from the intensity of the ultrasound.  My foot and leg will go numb randomly." I finished my therapy just a couple weeks ago and my shoulder feels much stronger than it ever has. These are great people and should I ever need physical therapy again It's been a few weeks since I completed treatment and I can happily say I ran a few miles this morning without any pain in my back. I've already referred a few friends to Matt and Andrea and would absolutely continue to do so. Not to mention that if I should ever need a qualified therapist again  they help to repair and strengthen all of the areas that were effected by the original injury. They believe in the whole body approach and work with you and your pain level. Yes "This place is awesome! I started my therapy after having surgery to repair a broken wrist. I was able to come in for my first session the DAY I got my cast removed There are also 2 offices. One is on the NE corner of 56th Street and Bell and the other is on 7th Street  who immediately put my daughter at ease and explained her injury then did a set of xrays.  Dr. Gruber then came in and let us know the course of treatment. Orders were sent out then and there and the nurses were also fabulous!!!  I cannot say enough good things about this office and the way we were treated. Thank you Arizona Bone & Joint Specialists for restoring my faith in the medical profession!!" "I saw Dr Tindall for a knee issue that hasn't been resolved.  I usually sit for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour each time  I met with PA (I believe her name was Kelly) and she took quite a while with me trying to understand symptoms and possible causes.  She relayed the info to Dr. Bruns saving me the trouble of repeating myself."  Dr. Schafer sent me to the best PT around-Aris.  And Dr. To went to school and studied with the same surgeons as my hand MD in Orange County
