- 2 Words - PETTING ZOO!  If you have kids - this is the place to go.  If you're bringing a date - SO the place to go." 1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA They have all kinds of themed days/nights with fun programming for kids.  It was even recently voted as one of the top 5 zoos in the U.S. for kids." I'd highly recommend the Phoenix Zoo as a leisurely and instructive afternoon's activity for the whole family."  I did meander over to the porcupine enclosure at just the right time and got to see her chase her handler around the enclosure and ""target"" for treats. I can honestly say I had never before seen a trained porcupine. The safari-type enclosure that houses the giraffes amongst other African animals is really cool. And the baboons LOVE having their photograph taken Just don't go in the heat of the summer ... holy cow was that miserable ... for us AND the animals who were pretty much all hiding out.  Phew!  but the walking is starting to get too much.  Some of the exhibits are not viewer friendly but all in all it is a good place to view the animals.  the zoo lights are not that spectacular Plain and simple - go find somewhere else to entertain yourself..."  I just hate seeing animals in captivity. I wouldn't want to be caged. Who knows  I wait for bondage night at Pat's Bunkhouse. At least then I can have a beer and not worry about the stench of feces. Oh I recommend coming here on a beautiful spring day. If it's hot outside For a Thursday afternoon I was surprised at how crowded it was. We were there for several hours  you may want to avoid Spring Break weeks if you don't care to be surrounded by thousands of screaming kids running around.  Those days it is truly a zoo.  I highly recommend purchasing a membership.  It pays for itself in only a few trips  that of the longhorns - was built into/around the natural desert landscape. Papago Peak was a gorgeous backdrop for the wildlife. One other really stand-out exhibit was the monkey habitat. There is a winding path through a bunch of trees Make sure to check out the ""open"" monkey exhibit - it is 1 of only 4 in the world.  You can step in to a fenced off arena that holds at least 30 little spider monkeys... this was one of the most unique experiences I have ever had at a zoo and I'm sure other people would say the same!"  bikes and stay all day . For little ones there is a huge tree house to play in  and a water splash place for summer." I do give 5 stars to the shark and sting ray petting area but it is really dumb you have to pay more to get in there. Luckily I knew the admission person who let me in but I remember it being a ridiculous price."  just having plain ol fun. The animals seemed alive and active. Just a beautiful experience. The Arizona Trail is great. It might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well. Some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages. The cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life. The Orangutans have a little baby Orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep. It was really cool. My favorite part is the giraffes. There were 5 of them this last time."  the kettle corn made on site is really good as well. If you want a salty-sweet snack  you can bring a guest! Kids under 2 are free anyhow but at $16 each for adults it's totally worth it after just a couple of visits." 1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA  Phoenix Zoo offers a decent variety of animals for such a hot climate. The exhibits fit in nicely with the terrain and you won't die of heat exhaustion trying to see the animals if you skip the summer months. But yeah. It's a zoo. You see crazy ass animals in habitats. 'nuff said." I don't ever buy snacks since prices are high. I'd recommend eating before you go. The zoo is very shady. I went last summer on July 8 and had a great time." Pack your own lunch. Fill a cooler and save big bucks that can be used to buy junk in the gift shop (or carry a a tantrum-throwing toddler over your shoulder back to the car  go early and take the train tour to save energy. Bring water!!" The exhibit is 7 days a week 9-10 AM. Highly recommend going being this exhibit is gone. Also stop by to see the new jaguar on display." Elephant day at the zoo yesterday was amazing!!! good day at the zoo. Highly recommended specially now that we are getting a good weather to spend the day outside  and it is important to know that it takes part in many conservation efforts and also serves as a sanctuary for unwanted/aggressive/abused animals.  It is an excellent place to learn Love the PHX Zoo!! All the animals were out and about and looked good. The weather was cooler in Oct. Staff was friendly. Kudos to @phoenixzoo on Twitter for getting us out and reminding us to go! It's also nice to come here in December when it's a little chilly and grab a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy Zoo Lights." 1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA Watching the mandrills pick insects off each other's butts to eat was itself worth four stars."  my daugther spends tons of time touching them.  It does cost extra for this exhibit but if you have kids it is worth it.  We did try a 2 person bike rental to view the zoo.  My suggestion is to have 2 adults peddling.  My child was not able to help much and my legs hurt and on some of the hills I had to push it.  If you are lucky enough I also love that the zoo has a social media presence. They're active on Twitter and always have deals and contests going on."  it will shake us off like a bad case of the fleas..."" George Carlin" My family is from a small city in Arizona. We moved to Phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children. I chose to live in S. Scottsdale specifically because the Phoenix zoo is about 2 miles away from my home." If you happen to be around during Dec-Jan definitely go see the zoo lights!"  the horse back riding classes ... this place has so much to offer.  My personal favorite exhibit is the Savannah and the new Komodo dragon exhibit is cool too. The membership is worth the money and pays for itself after just a couple of trips.  You also get free passes and discounts as part of the membership so I definitely recommend it.  Once you go there  this zoo is one of the better ones I've been to Love it! good for kids of all ages (and yes I mean you adults too!)  but can be finished in one day.  Doesn't have all the fluff that the San Diego zoo has. The safari is the best exhibit."  I'm not sure if its always as crowded as it was or if every pre-school in Arizona was taking a field trip here that day but it was so loud  that right - take your bike with you - it's awesome."  phoenix the reptiles were a variety my favorite reptile was the African bullfrog the desert animals i liked the big horn sheep the zoos also great for walking i only saw half of the zoo but the first part of the zoo wan great more animals than in northern California besides all the ants i recommend seeing the mountain animals first and my favorite animal in sea was the flamingo its not really considered water but it eats shrimp so enter  I would recommend your bikes so you can move quickly (or return quickly back later) to see if you can catch an animal sighting before they hide away to snooze when it gets too warm." - Animals could use some air conditioning..." A very enjoyable zoo.  I recommend taking someone that is mentally deficient. For sure go when it gets cooler but be prepared to fight the crowds."  I'd go back! It's an interesting way to spend the day & there's a special kind of bonding that takes place when you are seeing & learning about animals from all over the world. You make memories that will last a lifetime & that's priceless ;)" hiding mostly. Water ponds for animals were stagnant with algae! All in all Not a great experience. They are going to expand it seems...but they should pay more attention to the  animals they have .  Celtcharm"  I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo  no better place to enjoy spending some quality time with children plus you get valuable exercise." Extras are a bit pricey but overall it was a great way to spend the afternoon outside PHX is too hot in the summer to have these animals exposed to the outdoor elements here." Easy parking and great map to get around inside.  Highly recommended."  this is a great option for a family-fun weekend or a date. I've purchased a zoo membership for my sister Love ZooLights! We go every year. Wouldn't miss it for the world. The zoo is really nice and the staff are very friendly! Bighorn sheep and sanctuary are the most impressive exhibits !  Great use of natural landscape.   The operation oryx is a insipring history for the Phoenix zoo.  The other animal displays were quite normal and mundane. "I am not a huge fan of zoos but they have done a good job in keeping a friendly environment for both parties (the animals In town visiting and went to Zoo Lights for Christmas. Wonderful!!! The syncronized lights and music were great and we actually saw some of the critters awake. Sorry we didn't get to see the zoo during the day. The Children's zoo area is great.  Plenty of interactive play things and animals.  I just wish they could do something about the bee problem...  otherwise they'd be receiving a 5-star from me."  and surprisingly busy for a Tuesday afternoon.  ""free parking"" doesn't much feel like it when they ding you for admission...ouch All in all this is a great place to come relax or go exploring and have a great family outing or a 1st date! Give it a try!" We also recommend ending your day at Papago Park watching the sun set from Hole-in-the Rock."  and food court.. This zoo can definitely be completed within an hour or so but it will tire you out because things are kind of spread apart.. I was disappointed to find that many exhibits were unavailable for viewing during my visit but it was still a good experience.. Luckily most of the animals were within view when I was there and you could even see the ones that were asleep! If you're a fan of zoos like I am then I would recommend making the effort to come visit this place.." some people sit by the pool and relax - i site by the savana and relax"  make sure you do it. It is absolutely beautiful and it is a lot of fun to go with friends or family!" "OK-so we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was ""the busiest day of the year so far"" according to one of the workers.  We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said ""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat."" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said ""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue  this is a decent place for anyone visiting Phoenix to take some pictures or just pass a few hours."  I was impressed that you could get up close and personal witht the giraffes.  I've never seen anything like that before."  IL) I was shocked at the size of the Phoenix zoo.  It is HUGE!!  I thought most of the walking paths were very nice...some were no more than dirt trails and it would be nice if those ended up paved eventually.  It was nice that there were concession stands scattered throughout in case you were thirsty in the middle of the zoo.  It was also very nice that a good portion of the zoo seemed to be shaded which would be nice on a day with a very hot sun.  It was a bit disappointing that many of the description boards that talk were out of service.  It was also disappointing that some of the animals were hard to find though you will find that at any zoo.  I would definitely recommend a trip to the zoo especially if you have children." "The zoo is amazing and has something for everyone.  I love all the paths and trails.  The only drawbacks for me were the mass of strollers everywhere and the gross bathrooms.  I know you need to cart your kids around  my son enjoyed it. She was really knowledgeable and friendly. The staff has always been great every time we have gone here." "I've loved nearly every zoo I've been to in my life (which is basically limited to the Oregon Zoo in Portland and Zoo Boise) We love this zoo so much that we just purchased a membership.  It has everything one could want - it has a nice layout and plenty of items to keep the kids entertained.  From the jungle themed splash pad to the Children's Park and Petting Zoo.  We like to go early and that is when most of the animals are out and active.  The AZ heat can get pretty unbearable in the afternoon so plan to go early and bring plenty of water.  You can also bring your bikes and ride through the park for a fun and energizing trip. I enjoyed my one and only visit to this zoo during the evening christmas lights event they have every year. some animals were still out and the light show is a great family event. I was fairly disappointed with this zoo. Signage was unclear. Many of the exhibits were on loan. The petting zoo consisted of a large pen of goats.  the Phoenix Zoo is great family fun and one of my favorite spots in the Valley."  at the vet I suppose.  We saw the turtles on the way in and the giraffes at the entrance; besides that it was mostly birds and lizards.  For some stupid reason we didn't get there until around 11am or 12pm in July... BAD MOVE.  It's way too hot.  If you're gonna go a membership might be a great deal for those that like to exercise but like interesting views." "We were here on summer vacation. had a great time checking out all the animals. The only bad thing was how hot it gets. Wanted to see the ferret exhibit they promoted and it was closed. Other than that  this also keeps one from dissolving into a puddle of heated goo as the temperatures climb (if you're coming in summer).  We fixed this problem by getting a membership and coming during the member hour in the morning when we can.  The animals are more active and so are we.  I have had many wonderful conversations with keepers and docents alike here  are a refreshing change to those seen in many older zoos.  The exhibits are expansive and the animals seem happy and well cared for.  If you have kids The Phoenix Zoo is a great choice... preferably not during the summer." One of the most amazing sights was these 4 absolutely HUGE turkeys.  I am just wondering if they will still be around at the end of November!  Gobble  but not what you'd expect in a city this size.  Agree with previous comments that more indoor attractions would be desirable in this baking climate.  Only tip is to get there early!"  too?! What a horrible idea! Many of the exhibits were being maintained or he animals wee simply not there. The employees were racing around in their vehicles all day with little care for the visitors scurrying to not be hit. They had so many events planned for the day that the employees were over worked! At 10 after 4 employees were driving around asking everyoneto leave asap as there was a wedding scheduled for the evening. After paying $18 per person for this less than good zoo I believe the zoo has made a lot of improvements to animal care and additional funding has helped quite a lot.  All the animals we saw were in good heath and well taken care of." great job Phoenix Zoo and Zoolights. see you next year (or if the family ever comes to visit  because it's dark you can barely see any animals but the lights are the main attraction at night anyways. The displays were very neat and plentiful. There was even a synchronized music & light show that opened and closed with realistic thunder sounds. There was a huge slide kids can play on as well as carousel. Some of the food places were still open so you can snack while checking out the light displays. The entire zoo was literally covered in lights. This is a great event for kids and some places of it were romantic as well."  good time were had by all. Relaxing walk. Bring own food and drinks."  if animals interest you.  Arrive early Thank you to the Phoenix Zoo!" uRd4tIz303m3UVt8LGrIDA "I just got a yearly pass so obviously we are fans.  The down side is that not all the informational boxes for the animals are not all functional so that's a bummer.  Otherwise is a clean Great job Phoenix Zoo!" "What is not to love about the Phoenix Zoo! Everything here is so much fun.             You can walk around the Zoo or ride bikes. They have boats that you can rent and go all over the Zoo grounds.  Every type of animal is here.                                                         You can get a good look at all of them.  They do have food everywhere Poor form Zoo officials... guess no one was smart enough to check if people could actually view it properly. You just wasted a bunch of time doing something very cool that people could not really get the impact of."  Commenter Weinee.-----" I came here for Zoolights and it was really cool.  My local zoo doesn't have anything like it so it was really interesting and impressive.  I didn't really get to see any real animals except for zebras who were feeding right up against the edge of their pen.  I would really love to come here during the day to see the full zoo experience.  look out for the inserts. They have a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free admission!" "I went there with my wife when we first moved here from Chicago . it is a great zoo.big enough to have a lot going on and small enough and it will not take you all day to see everything  it's a fun place to visit. I love the monkey exhibit and the orangutans and what's really fun is that this is one of the only Zoos in the country that allows you to bring your bike to get around. It makes it easier to see all the animals if you are on a schedule or if it's very hot out (like it often is in AZ). Definitely recommended especially since you can easily get free passes. For visitors to AZ  but for parents with toddlers I would suggest the Children's Museum since your kids can get out run around and play vs being stuck in a stroller trying to catch a glimse at an animal."  the Phoenix Zoo is great. I've lived her almost two years and had never been. If you've yet to go Such a nice & fun zoo. The kids lived it!!!  they did close at 4pm for some reason so only had about 1.5 to walk around but I suppose that's enough time to see everything." "What a great place to take the kids for a fun day!  Camel rides - A travel size bottle of hand sanitizer could be useful as well."  but its still pretty cool.  This is my son's favorite place in the world to go because he loves all animals.  All the animals are pretty visible and they really do have so many animals.  I have been to other zoos and they do not have all the animals we do...they have a splash pad for kids that is awesome!  The petting zoo is pretty cool...just make sure to wash your hands!  They have an area that you can go in and be face to face wth monkeys...my son loves it...they are jumping over your head and are literally right there...but do not try to touch them!  You can pet and feed stingrays...and feed the giraffes.  They have a carousel for kids and camel rides too!  I love to see the otters  buy the membership. You can use the money you spent on the ticket that day towards a pass that will allow you entry for an entire year. It has to be the same day  and will likely end up spending LESS (with gas included) than at the Phoenix Zoo."  but you can see nearly every part of the enclosure. I also like the way the sections flow naturally from one into the next. Water is free unless you're opposed to using a water fountain. They're located all over the zoo. Still PS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well  easy to navigate and lots of special events to keep it adventurous. Zoo Lights every Winter is so much fun! Beautiful light displays "I have a love-hate relationship with zoos. It makes me sad to see the animals in captivity. But it makes me happy to see the animals at all! When I was a kid I loved reading about animals from other countries and the zoo was my favorite place to go. I had it a little mixed up in my head with the circus but I blame the fact that a lot of zoos have carousels. This zoo has the Endangered Species Carousel This is a good night walk place with your ""other"" and the fact that it's at night (away from the 110 degree day temperature) - got me sold. Loved it." This zoo is amazing.  Kids love it.  This is my 3rd year as a member.  I think that the best part ie the staff really love their animals. My kids love the zoo... The membership is cheap and is a really good deal if you plan on going often. Great place to take the kids for the day. ESP. Love the zoo lights!  I'm probably the least likely person to ever go to the zoo. To be honest  and the animals will hide from the heat. What I absolutely like is that they had this little play area for the kids just before you get to the petting area. My boyfriend and i took a break on the benches and let our 2 year old son play for a bit. It was a great experience overall." "I read the older reviews that thought it was way overpriced at $18.  Well now it is up to $30 and still way overpriced.  Went during the day and lots of animals were hiding in the shade as we should have been.  Didn't see much!!!  My advice is to go at night to see all the lights and not the animals  but being that I don't have kids...it was just ok. I thought it was overpriced (17$ for student admission) and the admission cost didn't even cover seeing stingrays or giraffes....pretty weak. Many of the animals were hiding (it's hot here) They have great events throughout the year and I especially love zoo lights which always gets me in the holiday spirit. The halloween activities are also fun for little ones and adults. The zoo always looks clean  you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water. Those ducks Still a great place to spend the day with the kids on a cooler day.. not in the heat of the summer." Good day out for the kids.  We went on a Saturday at around noon I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car "For people with kids this is a spectacular thing to do. We love bringing out of town friends and families with us and make an entire day out of it with a picnic and everything. We are members and go all the time. We love the summers because of the water entertainment for the kids. Now they have a winter slide that's super fun. Not to mention Zoo Lights (a family tradition!). My kids love to play at the tree house any time of year and we always find hidden pockets of entertainment. I can't forget to mention the sting-rays Nice little zoo.  The monkey house is pretty awesome!   The Haunted Zoo thing during Halloween is fun!  interactive monkey exhibits. Doesn't get any better! Gotta go to zoo lights! We've been members for a decade and never get bored!"  especially since AZ gets so hot during the summer. It's no different at the zoo - it's all outdoors. Plus "Really nice zoo with a layout that proves quite conducive to getting close to the animals but I must say the nickel and diming is a bit off-putting; $3 to look at Stingrays Animals sleep...go early at opening so you can see shows and animnals awake!  and maybe insect repellent year-round - even in cool weather the sun shines brightly and you will get burned  but it never felt crowded. The zoo was large and easily navigated. The friendly workers there made it such a wonderful experience  the Phoenix Zoo is pricing itself out of the market with the nickel diming that it's doing to its guests." I was a bit surprised at the low number of animals this zoo had. Maybe they are in transition? It was 20 bucks to get in and literally every animal was asleep except for the giraffes and the giraffe exhibit is monumental but they want to gig an extra 4 freaking dollars for it? COME ON! EVERY ANIMAL WAS ASLEEP. IT WAS WEIRD. The membership prices are great; I think the basic membership pays for itself in about 2.5 visits.  We go that many times in a month  and I think the idea of opening up the zoo at night for Zoolights is awesome. The scorching heat of summer does limit the times when I actually feel like visiting though."  but we felt confident because of the professionalism and care we received from the staff. The location was beautiful and everyone went the extra mile to make sure we were happy. All of my guests told me what a wonderful venue it was and many of them had a personal story about how Kelly or Maria had made a positive impression on them. We even had a free animal encounter for our guests! The location can't be beat  there are better zoos that are just a ""daycation"" away.  I recommend Bearizona and Wildlife World Zoo." Been many times before remodel and liked it Okay. Really good walking material and  a place to enjoy the weather in Phoenix. Post remodel completion I REALLY love coming out here. Nice little touches for the kids and little ones (I have 2 older kids and 2 young toddlers.) They don't overcharge for everything. (Some of the concession stands are high priced)  Lots of great exhibits and everyone in the park is great. Really clean and up to date. Animals seem very well cared for. Been out a dozen times this year and we live a long drive away. Well worth your time.  so if you ever visit San Francisco - skip the zoo. It's in a bad location and the exhibits are never complete."  but overall its a great place! its HUGE! so be prepared to be doing a lot of walking :-)"  but you can bring in your own  the Phoenix zoo is an amazing experience providing lifetime memories for visiting families.  A very well run zoo." "What is there to not like about this place? The only thing I can knock it on is that it isn't as big and bad as other zoo's. Nevertheless "Absolutely awesome! Allow four or five hours I loved this zoo! I'm from cincinnati and our zoo is great. I've also been to Columbus and that zoo is tough to beat. Overall I would say this is upward toward cinci's. I think going today was good timing because there were a few times I thought I was going to keel over from the heat and walking on the blacktop. I would guess going during the summer would be TOUGH! The animals were still out today and we were able to feed some giraffes and pet stingrays (: it was no surprise the food and drinks were overpriced but what can you expect.  Just bring your own to tote around and you're set. My experience was great and I imagine it'd be just as great for people with kiddos....if ya haven't been....go! Tuesdays are only $10 instead of $20."  make sure you check their schedule because their hours change depending on the season." "By far the best zoo in the valley. The year passes are great and pay for themselves. Plenty of shade and places to sit and rest Did camp zoo at phx zoo and the kids had a marvelous time. They got to meet the animals in their habitats and learn about the various animals in the park. One of the better camps in Phoenix. ZOO LIGHTS REVIEW: I got free passes from the Arizona Lottery and went with the fam. Beautiful all around. Just don't expect to see any animals. The main lights are all off so they can sleep. It's a beautiful place to go for a date night. Very ""magical"" feel and they serve hot cocoa among other drinks and snacks." Overall a awesome time as usual." It's a nice small zoo. The kids enjoyed feeding the manta rays. 99% of the concession stands were closed and it was really hot out This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!  expecting to be blown away. I am not well versed in zoo's other than as a mom of two young kids only to find an endless walk to see no animals. This zoo/park reminded me of a deserted zoo- could it be the time of year (Dec)- I don't think so.  Yelpers!! Take your money elsewhere. Did I happen to tell you that I asked for a refund and got a flat out NO REFUNDS. They offered tickets for another day but if I did not see any animals in the park why would I travel again for the same sub par experience?? The two supervisors listened with their Starbucks in hand and had a lot of reasons why our experience was terrible. Not exactly what I expect from a business." p.s. you can also get a ride on a camel"  etc. you had to pay more to participate. Seems a little steep since we had already paid $30 for one adult and one child's ticket. Zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair. A frozen lemonade was almost $6! Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do  I went to the Zoo in 100+deg weather.You know what? It wasn't all that bad. I took my little buddy there in the Morning. The park is very well shaded and there were several mister zones. We were able to see several of the animals get their breakfast. There were very few people at the park so I got to let my little buddy run free for a bit. We went to the petting Zoo and the goats got lots of toddler attention. Once it got a little warm out Had a fun time at the Phoenix Zoo with the kids yesterday.  I was thinking it what a waste of money & I was pissed & thinking I want my money BACK! Hey 4 tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see. It is so hot in a 3 digits degree. There are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides.  Finally  but it's not so overwhelming like some larger zoos. We just had my son's birthday party there and the hostess was fantastic and the ramada was lovely I'll go back next fall. With a coupon  and want to look at and buy all the toys at the end. I would rather pay more for a membership and then not have to bring extra cash EVERY time I go to the zoo just to ride the carousel or see the bat rays. Please "A whole day adventure! The zoo was a treat. I took a day trip from Tucson just for the zoo and wasn't disappointed. There is so much to see and there are several employees/volunteers at exhibits which educational tables or more information about the animal exhibits. Wear your tennis shoes and plan for a day to see it all so you don't feel rushed. Lions  animals tend to sleep in the mid-day so don't expect to see much activity then."  you can still find a way to see the animals.  One of my favorite attractions is feeding the giraffes.  We have been here a few times and still have not seen everything.  We'll be back soon.  Zoo lights is fun too!"  so eat before you get there if you can." I used to go to the zoo when I was little and now I enjoy taking my son. He thinks it's so cool and loves being able to see all the animals. :)  I like the new stuff...minus the area where the monkeys could possibly attack you...but I just sit outside  absolutely loved it. The one thing that absolutely killed my entire family's experience and the day of my family was the guy named Alan at picture kiosk toward the entrance. Definitely beware of his callous crabby attitude ruining a family day out. He treated us as if we didn't have feelings and ignored a lot of our questions. You'd think the customer was always right.... Nope. It's Alan's world." We went in November when they were just setting up for Zoo lights! I hope to return one day and get to see the zoo all lit up. I have been told it is very cool." Caleb loved seeing the animals we were able to see in the 45 minutes the zoo was still open to the public. I cant wait to take him back!  I'm sure a zoo membership is in our future. :)" A great date night and/or family night event to go to." 1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA "We went to see the zoo lights while visiting Phoenix.  I am certain the lights took a very long time to put up and people worked hard to put on the show but I  there sure is a ton if walking between exhibits. Very poorly planned if you have kids under 3 who want to walk. I would suggest heading west to the wildlife world zoo. My kids much prefer that zoo over this one." So much to do! We have the season pass so I never feel as if we have to see the whole zoo. Season passes are the way to go with families! Just wish their food prices were lower. Enjoyed this beautiful zoo while on vacation! Perfect weather in December. Best part is the interactive activities they have for the kids. My favorite experience was riding the camel. Staff are very polite and make the experience much more enjoyable. Thank you Katie for a great event!" This zoo is beautiful. It was my first time at the PHX zoo and also my sons first time at the zoo ever. He loved it. Amimals are amazing and the staff was helpful. Prices are very affordable and the year pass with unlimited year access is the best value. If your thinking about going... DO IT. Great family fun!! With everything at the zoo has to offer it is a great place to spend a day. Plus with Zoo Lights every year it makes it even better." Great place to kill a few hours and enjoy animals!"  the narration on the safari train was too soft to be heard over the chatty passengers It was a nice zoo but VERY small. And I mean extremely small. I've been to free zoos that have more to offer. You could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace. Not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals. Not worth the price in my opinion. mile to make our day. Our daughter loved every minute. Feeding the giraffes was also a huge high point of the day! We will be back!"  bring in your own water and snacks because they can be a bit pricey there. The camel rides are fun for children and the tickets are only 5 bucks per person! This is a very clean and well kept zoo "People who give the Phoenix Zoo 5 stars have never been to a world class zoo like San Diego.  If you have kids this is a great place to take them since there are  a lot of things for them to do.  For adults Overall this is a pretty good zoo. I would recommend bringing kids here or even if you just want to have a good day trip outside while it is still nice and not an inferno.  Return factor: 70%" "Had a great day at the Zoo today!  I hadn't been there for a while and we decided to just go.  Weather was perfect (mid 70's) and it was during the middle of the week.  There were a few schools there on field trips but other than that I love this place and take the kids there whenever we get the chance.  just simply missing. With many display of wiled pigs to act as fillers in now empty exhibits.  Adding to it. It is highly over priced. If this was drastic park and I was goingbto see a dinosaur They also have a place to pet goats! That was sweeeeeet." PLEASE clearly post senior rates on admission booth signs. Please enlarge the big cats exhibits. Well planned landscaping for shade! Hotdogs are $6. Not much else to eat (that I saw)." "Really nice zoo. We were there for a wedding at the Desert Tents. What a magical location! The staff was great and it was gorgeous. There is a large fire pit in the middle and 5(?) tents. The bride and groom had one for music Would love to come back early in the morning when the animals are more active."  but it is a good place to walk around and get some fresh air."  you won't tire out as fast and you can see the animals when they are out and about."  I have to congratulate the Phoenix Zoo for their efforts on animal conservation. I read somewhere sometime ago that they took an endangered species -- on the verge of extinction -- and  all of which looked miserable and very dirty. There was not a single exhibit that I thought was well maintained with happy animals. The ground squirrels living near the zoo were more fun to watch than the actual animals in the zoo. They also make you pay extra for anything extra.  A regular ticket doesn't include much except walking around.  They would charge you extra to sneeze if they could."  but I liked it better that way. We were able to see everything available without having to spend the whole entire day there. It was a lot easier for the kids! Feeding the giraffes was the best part. The monkeys jumping around right above your head was pretty amazing as well!! Overall  which is one of the coolest areas around Phoenix. If you'r planning to go more than once in a year  so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review." I love going to the zoo in Phoenix zoo is really good make sure you don't leave without feeding the stingrays it's an awesome experience "I have received a letter from the zoo apologizing (and a refund) for the rude employee. I am not satisfied in that I felt like I wasn't believed that the employee used derogatory remarks in front of my child but I will never return to this Zoo again Enjoy and thanks Phoenix Zoo!"  pack bathing suits and towels and hit up one of the splash pads area."  the Phoenix Zoo is a fun experience and from the looks of their current construction projects  etc. It is a large place with plenty of animals to see. I love the Arizona Trail; all the things that are right in your backyard are there! Well  it was great for what we paid. Food was overpriced (of course) but it was a nice way to relax in the heat. My favorite part was the Orangutan exhibit.  We got to watch them feed and play around with the zoo keeper." If you are flying into Phoenix and have a 4+ hour layover this is a great place to kill time.  It may be a relatively small zoo but it is very nice.  I really enjoyed the corner devoted to native Arizona fauna.  Cab ride is 15 bucks and is only about 5 miles away. "What a great zoo! There is plenty more to do here than just watch the animals. We have a toddler and going to the zoo is now an entirely new experience... the petting zoo Get an early start if you want to see more animals  Tours and Experiences were closed. They did tell us one was closed but failed to mention the other 5. Be sure to contact them before you go! Even the seasonal (yes  we walk instead of taking the ""safari train"" and it is a great source of entertainment for 2 hours on a weekend. We love when the staff is out and about near the exhibits If you have AAA bring your card as you will get a discount on your tickets :-)" We went closer to closing time and practically had the place to ourselves. Their hours change seasonally so check online before heading out!"  get exercise and view the beautiful animals!  I love feeding the stingrays too!" This zoo is fantastic. My family and I have only been in AZ for 2 months and we've already been three times. Their membership is totally worth the money. This is a fun place to come to get exercise while having fun. Our kids love the zoo. They don't get tired of it. We always pack a lunch so I'm not sure how their concessions stack up. We've taken the train once and that was okay. We prefer walking around and going at our own pace. If you plan on going to this zoo a few times a year then I would definitely go for the membership. Ver nice clean zoo. Better than most zoo's that I have been to. Would never come in the summer time because of the heat. I got the pass and it's great to take my son.  Members get in an hour early. Which is nice to beat all the field trips This just might be my favorite place in all the Phoenix area. Been going all my life and look forward to continuing that tradition with my family. The Phoenix Zoo is so amazing and one of my favorite places. I find that each time I am there I encounter something new to see. The staff has a deep love for animals and really embraces what they do. Ive done volunteer events there to and they are highly accommodating. I came here with my husband and my mother in law for the zoo lights program while we were visiting over Thankshibing. It's always cool to be at a zoo after hours. I wish they had more animals on display. The lights were very well done. I've never really seen lights done in the shape of animals like that before. We also participated in the feeding of the sting rays and the carriage ride. The carriage rise was very cool because you got to see parts of the zoo that are normally closed off to the public. The driver could have been more informative and explanations of the zoo as she just started the horses and talked to her friend.  this place was really enjoyable." had a great afternoon at the zoo. Haven't been to one in about 6 years and loved every minute of it today. This zoo was clean and the staff is friendly. Overall a great experience!  very much like most of the other zoos I've patronized but better than average in my opinion;  but my kids never tire of it. We go to Zoolights every year on Thanksgiving night as a family tradition." How is it the honolulu zoo could do it for $48 dollars? I understand supporting a good cause but??? come on?? Because of the price of that I will never be able to afford to take my kids back there again. Just way to high and not nearly enough bang for the buck. Poorly done." Great place to see some pretty Christmas lights. We go every year and will be back this year too!"  or you could take the trolley tour.  Some of the animals were just lying there and it wasn't even warm out.  If you like zoos this seems to be a pretty good one with some exotic animals.  There were some giant floating ants in the canal that looked like they might glow in the dark "Very relaxing and peaceful zoo. I could easily see myself hang out  but it could also be that fabulous winter weather in Arizona." Best time to go is in the cooler months unless you take the bicycles that are provided and no kids to carry or push in stroller."  great exhibits. I've been during the day & in the evening for Zoo Lights as well. One of the best zoos I have ever been to. If you have little ones & are looking for something to do This zoo is a really great place to visit. Go and experience all the animals here. You won't regret it."  even play areas for the children. My son loves to dig for worms behind the petting zoo and play inside the prairie dog tunnels. The only thing I would have anything negative to say about is the exit.... The main exit is through the gift shop. As often as we go with our membership I'm bringing everyone I know that visits from out of town to this place. As long as it's not in June "It is ok. We hardly saw any animals (better luck on the internet). The price point was ridiculous as well.  As much as the idea of a trip to the zoo sounds fun I do not think anyone really has fun anymore especially the animals.  Most of the animals we did see looked lethargic. The tiger just paced frantically back and forth and two zoo animal signs indicated they had legs amputated due to injury. And the people at the zoo missed some opportunities. Maybe instead of renting strollers and carting your kids all over the money trap (I mean zoo) The food at the small snack shacks is decent: I've only had the chicken quesadilla and it was decent.  The prices for food aren't ridiculous either.  You can also bring your own food with zero issues which I wholly appreciate.  I ordered a PB&J in case my son might want some... they serve UNCRUSTABLES.  DISgusting garbage.  I'd rather feed my kid popcorn than that. yuk.  Ok I thought I was at the Disney ticket booth."  the thing I didn't like was the one lonely elephant there. Better if they allowed her to go to a sanctuary with other elephants."  this one is perfect. The only downfall is they have signs preventing lawful gun owners from carrying their weapons inside the zoo."  they nap in the afternoon heat.   The trails meander past very nice enclosures and the animals appear very well cared for.  There is a blend of natural Arizona species and the typical zoo animals.  I will definitely go back!"  but you can also slow down your experience and have lunch/visit the souvenir shop. I'm a fan of this place and definitely recommend it  sheep and horses :) and they have a well maintained playground for kids. My favorite animal in that zoo is the lion!i have an annual membership and I am planning to renew it"  so we decided to stop here for something fun to do. We were pleasantly surprised because it was decently priced ($20 for general admission) and parking was free. There were a lot of animals and for the most part they seemed content and their exhibits were well kept. The only thing we did not like was the lack of information about each animal. Other than the species name and a few facts Worth the visit! Make sure to plan for 3+hours there (depending upon company/age of children). Check Groupon or Living Social for discount deals." Take plenty of water and enjoy the stroll." Not a bad zoo at all. Plenty of things to look at. The rose garden is in bloom and smells divine. Some construction going on next to the elephants. Not sure what exactly they are adding or updating. I really don't favor this zoo over the world wild life one. They have some different predictors and prey animals. Booth are totally worth going to. Phoenix zoo has two water play areas for children and a tree house style play ground thing next to the carousels. Great way to spend the afternoon.  and customer service can make or break a potential purchase of a family membership.  I was so disappointed and will never forget this lady and my experience on this day.  I complained to the Phoenix Zoo and never heard back.    Coming from the East Coast and having been to other zoo's around the country very cool place to take the kids. the stingray bay was the best part in my opinion the food is a bit spendy so if your on a budget bring your own. also the safari train was not worth the extra money and the 4d theatre plays a 10 min movie clip also not worth it. but still a fun time  but the customer service has been pretty bad on my experiences. I will try once more and will add an update to the review on my third time coming here. In case anyone wants to come. Come prepared with snacks cause they will not treat you nice at the snack bars. I would give the zoo a 5 star rating This is one of my favorite zoos because they truly help try to make a difference in the animal's daily lives. I like to see that the animals they have are rescued rebility David and they are constantly raising money to improve the animals living conditions and the entire zoo. I love to see when the animals are getting a check up and all the things they need to stay cool and healthy. I don't have a favorite thing in this do because I love it so much when I go with my family I always have to see every animal twice or we can't go home. It's a lot of fun because we are members for three years in a row and we get to take advantage of a lot of their amenities without paying a lot of money. with the zoo membership we are able to go as much as we want without having to pay admission. the memberships pay for them self in to visit and the best thing about it is 2 and under are free so while my daughter will be turning 3 she is still free until the membership expires next year. we all had a good time and it was in the low 90's when we went." Once we left we took a stroll up the hill and hike around the area.That was fun too." Hint: Bring a wagon for carting things around. There are a good number of play areas and activities that the kiddos want to do. A wagon lets someone manage the stuff while the other is with the young ones."  is a four hour window in late January." "Disappointment! We live in Phx and went on an unusual cool day in June. Some animals were out but most were not. The zoo is redoing their food so there is only one place to get it in the park. Speaking of the food 1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA "One of the best zoos I have been too! I love how the animals have a lot space to enjoy themselves and are not just locked up in a smaller cage. Because of how much room the animals have it does require a lot of walking around to get from place to place. Also Very nice zoo. Love that they are open early at 7 during the summer (especially great for young kids who wake up at the crack of dawn anyway!) Only bummer is none of the food vendors are open until 9 or so. Such a great zoo!!! The grounds are well kept and walking straight into see the giraffes is my favorite part. They also have a tall hit the kids can climb to look at them. I say it's a must visit. The zoo only gets better very year.  It is one of the best zoos in the country.  The new 4D experience is a great addition. Wonderful to have this place nearby."  the zoo has stopped participating in the culture pass (allowed for two admissions). Hopefully Love the Phoenix Zoo!!! They have really stepped up their game on the recent remodel and additional exhibitions. I suggest getting here as early as you can during the summer months. If you are a member you can get in an hour before they open; 6am. Feeding time for the animals and fun for the kids at 6am.  etc.  I like that each time I come I see more improvements.  It is an absolute mad house during the holidays--come early or expect to park in the overflow lot a mile away!" "Great place to bring the family... The kids loved all the animals on exhibit... It's very hot still so bring lots of water... Stay hydrated... Good sized zoo and a lot of animals... The park ranger drives around and gives out water  the tiger was very active and jumped into the tree twice." "Not a bad zoo as far as organization and animal species. Be sure to say hi to the Galapagos tortoise during feeding time. But there's a lot of walking  just a little bit hilly walk.  Enclosures look good and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Granted in the summer not as much fun but we all know why not the zoo's fault haha.  All in all fun day for the family and an extra shot out to their zoo lights display during Christmas." Very nice zoo....what was open anyway. We went today and nearly all of the concessions were closed. Big deal when it's 100 degrees out. Also with many of the exhibits closed it was a bit pricey. Many areas under construction but it looks like the new additions will be a great add to this zoo.  Recommend you wait a couple months so the park can get caught up on its projects and the heat goes down.  and splash areas. The food is terrible but you don't come here for the food! Zoo Lights during the holiday season is lots of fun." Great place for adults and kids! And thank you for giving military discount! Oh Joey love the splash pad too!  lots to see and do. We got here right after a light rain storm passed through."  4D movie and safari train. The safari train is not worth it. It travels on the same path used by walking patrons and if you are lucky you might see 50% of the animals you pass.  The movie is a fun diversion "Nice zoo. It was overcast and rainy so it was perfect weather for this zoo  animals all seem happy and well taken care of. Staff is kinda and friendly" Great zoo!! Loved feeding the giraffes! It's small and intimate. The habitats are beautiful and the animals all look so well cared for.  and been coming to the zoo  since my elementary school days and now finally experiencing it with my little one. We enjoyed roaming around this past Sunday with  some friends from out of town. They also recently added a cool 4-D attraction. We saw the Ice Age one and the kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Also you're allowed to bring in your own food and the zoo has ample amount of  picnic tables scattered through out. We're definitely coming back for more visits as the weather is cooling down."  I work for a local nonprofit and we are proud that they sponsored one or our charity events.  Keep up the great work Phoenix Zoo." Such a great zoo!! It is conveniently located next to the botanical gardens if you also want to do that. But the zoo has plenty to do. A really cool spider monkey area that are so close you could almost touch(don't touch though lol). Great kids areas too. And a great hiking area right next door if you are in the mood for that! Camel rides!!!!!! Lol The zoo was difficult to find and the entrance not as clearly marked as you would think. Totally worth it. The have tons of customizable experiences to fit your interests. I opted for the Safari ride and feeding giraffes. You can also get your 10k steps in a day easily without even trying. I went with the 28 dollar tix which included some extras like a 4D movie. Thank you for the free veteran's admission today. It's not an expense I can normally justify so this was a real treat. I spent 6 hours there. Part of the most special day I can remember. SB from Northern California"  we came to Halloween and the zoo which was Awesome!! Looking forward to Zoo Lights this Holliday!!"  like how one was available to stay and talk to us about their Galapagos tortoise and answer questions for a bit after he brought a tour group in to be up close and personal with it. We have also seen the orangutans being fed corn on the cob and their keepers being available to answer questions as well. Very nice and knowledgeable staff  not on exhibit or just too irritated to want to be seen. There also wasn't that many daily events going on... in comparison to my experience at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. I'm sure the Phoenix Zoo at night is pretty cool but this Zoo experience wasn't spectacular during the day. I'm not really a fan of this place and probably won't return. There was some pretty cool things but they cost extra ($3/$2) per attraction within the zoo. Water itself was $3.29. Food prices were obviously very expensive as well and I'd recommend packing in your own water  and hope that it isn't nap time again so we can observe the animals doing something other than snuggling the day away." The zoo was not very crowded on the day of our visit and the layout of the park was lovely.  There was so much to see an overall a great spot to visit while in the Phoenix area!"  and have already visited enough times to make it worth it. Its just tough to love a zoo like this when we came from a FREE St. Louis Zoo. The monkey exhibit is our favorite and its nice that its so close to the Botanical Garden." I called the information phone number and the chick told me I can go early and check out the zoo before the zoo lights and didn't warn me that the zoo lights doesn't open til 5:30 so I've been waiting here since 4:00pm I don't live close to here so I'm stuck waiting til 5:30 pm and I'm very disappointed  the elephants wouldn't be around which was disappointing. Food is really expensive and honestly doesn't taste very good. I came here with a guy I was dating at the time "What a great zoo. The park is laid out very well and there are some amazing areas dedicated to the animals. There is lots of little things for my 3 kids to do throughout the park. As a teacher  the zoo looked great.  I got many good pictures.  Just wish there was more space for each of the animals.  The enclosures are so small for birds of prey like the Eagles." "I'll skip the traditional lions and tigers and bears oh my! And get right down to it. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 kiddos. 9.12.and 14. Finding something reasonable to do all day isn't easy to do. Animals are something we can all agree on. I got something in the mail for a membership for the zoo  the zoo staff provided us with COLD pizza that was sitting out for maybe 2 hours in 50 degree weather. Limited drinks "The food and bottled water are WAY over priced and the member discount doesn't really help. Other than that  if not all day there. You definitely get your money's worth. The food is your typical zoo food at your typical zoo prices." $100 in 3.5 hours? I can think of better ways to spend both that time and money." I love conservation minded and exhibit Innovative zoos!" Went to the zoo today we had a wonderful time. They have some great features! Got to play with stingrays they are really awesome! Experienced my first 4d movie. Got to feed a giraffe and took a train around the zoo out was a great experience!! "my boyfriend and i visited the phoenix zoo when his family came into town this weekend. we were pleasantly surprised at how clean and expansive the zoo really was. we walked the entire zoo then had lunch. the food was tasty too. after "2 stars might be two too many. Just relocated to Phoenix so we thought we would try out the zoo. We saw a total of 4 animals. They are scarse. There was a face painting line that we stood in line for 20 minutes and several people came up and made their own line. The heat must make people rude Lots of changes make this one of the better zoos for families.  My kids especially like the new water splash area and caves.  and be in a monkeys home with them just swinging around above your head??  This place is truly a Phoenix gem and never tire of strolling through and observing the nature and beautiful creatures this place has to offer." Overpriced. General adult admission  $20. The animals look hot and tired. We spent 2 1/2 hrs walking around and never really got excited.  and pedal boats on the pond. Great exhibits set up and very unique desert feel throughout the park. Large gift shop and several options for food and snacks."  then the ""Total Experience"" package is not needed. Train and 4K movie are already included in basic package. Also remember to ask for the Senior Discount."  but that is beside the point. The price was a little steep for ""general admission"" and they only gave us one ticket with the military discount despite being an entire military family. All in all it was a good day at the zoo with our family. Lots of walking and lots of animals to see."  it almost feels like you're taking a little hike especially when you enter the ""Arizona Trail"". It took me almost four hours to go over everything. Some of the trails are dirt so I recommend you wear comfortable closed toe shoes. Some of the enclosures are very "Love This Zoo! There Are Lotsaof Animals and very Cools Exhibits! Bring Yours Walking Shoes  a member gets in an hour early :) This means we can go before the sun really starts to beat down and the park isn't as full." We like the zoo but the bathrooms need to be addressed."  so it's not like you get any closer than the average pedestrian. I suppose it's good if you want a break from all the walking! You do have to reserve tickets in advance for the ride. Decent food options. Hot afternoon when I went I think I prefer the World Wildlife zoo than the Phoenix zoo. The only thing is that this has a more central location than the other one."  ohhhh where to begin .. I have to say first make sure you park in front of the zoo. We were told by a person sitting in a yellow vest to park here and it was a mile walk to the zoo. Usually that would be no big deal. But we had two small children we had to carry with out diaper bags ...just to find out .......right in. Front of the zoo they had tons of free parking !!!!! Zoo was awesome I reply enjoyed my time there. I would highly recommend getting the annual pass if you live close !! They had tons of exhibits and a play area with water for the kids . Make sure you wear comfy shoes !!! Sunscreen is a must"  the Phoenix Zoo is a better zoo than the other options hands down. If you care about the welfare of the animals  can just become a bit complicated if you want to see everything as there's many small paths crossing eachother and you often end up where you started." I would recommend this for any parent with children as young as 18 months! It wears the kids out and I get a good 2 mile walk in for the morning :)"  so pretty. But here's where you lost me- the workers had SUCH terrible attitudes. Never in my life had I had a woman at a carousel speak to me the way she did! Next time I come here I should hold a GD Ted Talk. Give these workers a lil attitude adjustment that they need courtesy of me ZACH! The lady with the goats was very nice though. 5/5 stars for her- NO ONE else though." Had an amazing day at the zoo!!! Little warm outside but totally worth the memories made. Took our youngest for the first time today and he absolutely loved it. It's been 6 years since we have been and we need to make a point to go more. Thank you and we will hopefully be back again soon Loved the zoo. The animals were very active and it was clean. There were lots of exhibits they were done well. We enjoyed our time but the heat today was unbelievable !" "We love the Phoenix zoo. We've been going for 12 years!! It's changed so much & keeps getting better & better!!!! It's so fun  the heat made the animals stay in the shade and limited movement- no fault of the zoo but didn't see a lot of animals well due to it."
