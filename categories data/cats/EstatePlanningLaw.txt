He pointed out the important parts of the documents that were there and why they needed to be. He made some suggestions but was not pushy about additional services in anyway. I would highly suggest Michael for any and all Business Michael was great at getting our estate planning in order. Everything went smooth and very timely. I have a great sense of comfort knowing all our papers are in order. If I need anything else in the future I will certainly use Michael Tucker again.
