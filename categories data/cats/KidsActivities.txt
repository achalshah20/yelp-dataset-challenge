The nature preserve is open and free for all." "My son went there on a class field trip. Friendly and passionate staff. Great place to learn about nature and for ""planting the seed"" of protecting/respecting the environment." Phenomenal experience for the whole family! It's amazing because you're right in the midst of an urban setting but the prairie is native and the setting is stunning. My daughter loved seeing the turtles floating on logs and the rabbits hopping along the trails. We became a member on our first visit. It's a great organization to support.  love the educational space. Beautiful building. Education staff is rocking!" Just finished hiking this. Very peaceful with tons of birds chirping.  70 percent shaded.  Easy parking and friendly staff.  Clean bathrooms.
