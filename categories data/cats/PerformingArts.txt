Audience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for." I honestly want to look for things put on here now because I like the theater so much. Support your local theater  and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch."  we had tickets to see The Chamber Music Pittsburgh's Pablo Villegas with free tickets won from WYEP radio station.  Mr. Villegas is a Spanish classical guitarist and this venue was just the right size in which to enjoy his performance.  The sound system was superb."  but these were less remarkable.  I think I might have actually disliked certain performers and the costumes and sets were borrowed design from other companies. I think you can feel it when it's not a complete production. 3 stars."  booze . . . opera has something for everyone.  And in a world where everything is instant gratification The building I have to say was quite beautiful.  Exposed brick all over the place.  Great reuse of a building and quite unique I have to say.  Parking to attend anything here I would imagine is hard to find seeing that it is in the Strip District.  But once you find your spot and walk into the building you definitely know you're in for a good time."  they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera."  and many live venue theaters and musical offerings in our city. I urge people who have never been to the opera before to support the Pittsburgh Opera and take in a show.  You will not be disappointed."  I highly recommend taking advantage of this cultural treasure.  Even if you've never seen an opera performance before Go see something so you can stop singing the same Cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the place!" So I will continue to raise my jazz hands high year after year here because I'm proud of all those talented Pittsburgh peeps!"  there are several free street parking options if you drive around for a few minutes.  Or bus it for $2.25 (at your own risk)." aqNwplp89UTe8dfGXj_yKA  to name a few. Always professional and enjoyable. You can order food and or drink  the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show." I look forward to my next visit to CLO." The ushers and other staff were all very polite. I was also impressed by some of their past shows they had displayed on the wall and would definitely go back for another show!" Overall this is a great place to see a show. It's not too big so you still feel part if the performance. The staff is friendly and the plate we had of snacks was really great. Will be keeping an eye out for upcoming shows."  not wait for 15-20 minutes more to give your check with payment to the server so they can charge you.  We thought we could go out to the bar and pay there.  Well we were wrong.  I actually ended up ordering another drink finished it and paid for that one at the bar before our waiter came to collect our tab.  I think in the future my best bet maybe to just pay cash or order at the bar to begin with.  Otherwise loved the place and look forward to coming back to see another great show!" Four stars instead of five because the will call staff was really rude.   I won free tickets (plural) or so I thought.   When I went to will call   etc. I see a lot of shows and very rarely do I pay full price for a ticket.  My second tip is for parking. Come in close here because I'm about to tell you one of my most valuable secrets.... Parking can be free downtown if you're willing to park on the street after 6:00 and walk a few blocks. Granted it's not available on every street but if you scout around you can usually find a spot. Last night I parked on 3rd Ave close to the PPG Building. Sure I had about a ten minute walk to the theater but it feels good to get the circulation going."  and he was phenomenal. There were lots of jokes and good songs with some more tender thoughtful moments near the end.  It's a 90 performance without an intermission  I'll be bringing my friends for a Girl's Night Out and bringing other couples for date nights. What a fun way to spend time together-a meal and a show. LOVED IT!!!!" We're so lucky to have the CLO. Pittsburgh has certainly made a name for itself within the arts and theater world. So many musicals have been performed here in Pittsburgh and the shows are always top-notch quality. "We saw the Pittsburgh CLO's production of Shrek the Musical last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! The characters were perfectly cast and were quite entertaining! Although all of the songs were different from those in the Shrek movies Seeing shows put on by the CLO is a great way to get out in downtown and enjoy the cultural district. Everyone should try to make it out."  the Public Theater makes for a wonderful night downtown.  (I guess I am writing a review to encourage others to ""Come On!  Give it a try!  You might like it!"").  The theater itself is the perfect size and the stage can allow for an up close and personal experience when you almost touch the actors to a balcony seat which offers some distance (but not too much!).  I started coming to the theater after seeing ""The Secret Letters of Jackie & Marilyn"" and then bought in 2008 starting buying season tickets.  The selected productions range from slightly high-brow to fun  so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!" I just saw Superior Donuts! Fantastic show with a REALLY talented cast! This show will definitely go down as a favorite of mine! "Just saw ""God of Carnage"" it was well acted and funny. A good night out. Don't expect a resolution but do expect a good time."  FANTASTIC performance  one can hear and see well from everywhere in the theater. Customer service has been very good when I have needed to exchange my tickets for another night.  I also recommend the Preview Night We have been here a few times and have will definitely be back for more!" "I saw Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"". Great performance!" I almost forgot how much I enjoy plays and I hope to see shows here more often!  Don't delay as I did and check out a show here sooner rather than later." The Public SHOULD be that venue. And their productions SHOULD be on that exceptional level.  Sadly  my best friend and I saw Camelot here at the O'Reilly Theater while she was visiting from Florida. I was impressed by how nice the theater was and the caliber of actors performing. I have absolutely no reason or excuse why I haven't been here in a little over 3 years! I finally returned two nights ago to see Company. I truly left the theater smiling after this performance. I thought the actors were very talented Overall this is just another great addition to the Pittsburgh's cultural district." "What a great theater.  Pretty much every seat in the house is a good seat.  The venue has seating and cocktails before showtime and the staff is very helpful Today I went to see the Glass Menagerie  wait until people my age get old. I can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater. You are going down just like the PSO."  and upon arriving at our seats I was pleasantly surprised by the nice view we had directly overlooking the stage. The one minor issue we encountered was that the ushers were unsure of where exactly our seats were located I had a great seat near the front so I felt like I was in the heart of the action. This production was one of the best I had ever seen and truly brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this show and am looking forward to future productions there."  an usher occupying one of our seats in the third row in the middle. The usher asked my girlfriend and I if we would be ok sitting apart as she was not going to move out of her seat. She then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't a full house and we could find plenty of seats together higher up in the theatre and stayed in the seat for the duration of the show. Without helping anyone to their seats of course. It's a terrible shame "We saw the play ""Disgraced"" last night at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre.  We attend most performances and have for several years. This was an outstanding production! Acting was wonderful!  Play ends on April 10th - highly recommend getting tickets and seeing this play - it is one not to miss!"  the seats in the upper balconies are extremely tight giving taller people very little leg room." (and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!)"  then please don't take 'em and ruin the show for everyone else   ;)" THE place to catch touring Broadway shows so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert. but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears. red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy. betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this. hope its open forever."  Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh Pricing is quite reasonable too. You can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center. $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house. I love that on the website you can choose your own seats. Parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage. Take some time out to visit this theater!"  of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer "I recently attended La Traviata here.  Great show!  The Benedum is a fantastic facility for the arts and a true asset to the Pittsburgh region.  The only reason why it is not 5 stars  it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season." I am taking off two stars because a Captain and coke and glass of red wine cost $22.00." The few downsides to the theater are the high prices for drinks (but that is expected at any location like this) and the lobby gets really cold on winter days from all the patrons coming in and out.  Theater doors usually open around a half hour before curtain time I understand that the Pittsburgh opera needs to get cheeks in seats and that groupon buyers do not constitute their normal patrons On a final note: I can't comment on the small cash bar and snacks that are in the lobby during shows  we got a chance to take in the beauty of the theater  sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty  and I was completely impressed.  This is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details.  It is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it  but you have to pay extra if you want to carry it into the actual show.  Kinda strange Do check into it and BUY!!!" I like coming here. Saw the Lion King. Bathrooms get crowded so you better hurry.  I'll be back. "Mom forgot her cane in the coed restroom.  Mom went to see Evita.  She says the lead performer got a standing ovation.  Mom said the people attending the event looked decent but they weren't really dressed up.  It was such an older crowd that they came and left in Access SUVs and a school bus.  The opera noted that they started in Oakland in someone's living room and the opera has been in Pittsburgh for seventy-five years.  Mom said the venue was packed but the last three rows were empty and that's where she sat for her rush ticket.  Mom said this place was pleasant because of the calm crowd.  When I asked mom how multicultural the crowd was.  She said there were a few groups of Chinese people and a few African Anericans  but they made me feel like a priority and took great care of me. I look forward to my other shows here!" Excuse me while I enjoy my nuts."  which was amazing!!! The one thing I really have to applaud about the Benedum is that the seats are all pretty good. I am on the shorter side and have never had trouble seeing  the seats are decent -- unfortunately last night we sat in left orchestra and missed the end of the ballet because it was being performed on the left hand side of the stage (behind the big post that is to the left of the stage). Other than that everything I've ever seen there has been phenomenal!I would say choose balcony seats before left or right orchestra I was here for about 4 hours and got to the see the Pittsburgh Ballet Company perform Swan Lake...the dancers were amazing. The pit orchestra was fantastic. The theatre was simply breath-taking. Such an amazing experience - especially for my first time seeing a ballet! Bravo!"  my husband and I saw the Alton Brown Live show. I had a great time and really look forward to returning in just two days for Porgy and Bess!"  I mean Alton Brown.  That was awesome. #humblebrag.)  I have had some difficult conversations with staff members in the ticketing office  I have never sat in an area where I couldn't see and I am vertically challenged so it's nice to know that even seated in the back I am able to see the show before me.  I look forward to many more visits in the future So I cannot wait until my next Benedum adventure shows itself and I will see Bonamassa every chance I get.  And yes.  I'd do the exact combo again.  But both of my 5-star favorites will get 4-stars if I have to sing in my head (well  I unfortunately don't have enough money to get front row seats. I usually buy the bargain seats in the back for $10-$20 dollars. What's cool is once the show begins you can move up to seats that aren't occupied. You may pay $10 Four stars for the beauty; definitely not for the seats."  bumping me each time she moved about. Her mother was very rude and took a phone conversation during the show. I do believe that there should be better crowd control because of this. The ushers should be watching for such behaviors because it really does ruin the viewing experience. You are unable to take photos That concludes review #200!" It's a beautiful venue and would get my 5 star rating if seating on the upper tier were comfortable.  Alas  they don't always inform you of special name entertainment unless you are a donor. I've missed out on a couple of these attractions for that reason. Still the ticket prices are way less than what you'd pay to see the same show on Broadway and I feel it is worth your money." I will always be back to this theater."  and chandeliers.  From the moment you step on to the sidewalk out front you are greeted by gentlemen who open people's car doors and escort them into the building.  There are wonderful employees who check your tickets and show you which way to go. The ushers walk you to your seat and give you a program. I'm blessed to have been enough times that I know which seats I love the best. I've never seen a bad performance and have always enjoyed my experiences. It's sad to leave and walk back into the real world."  amazing lights. The sound was great for a large space. Seats were relatively comfortable but we didn't really sit much. Had some amazing roasted cinnamon cashews too. I would love to see more there!"  amazing lights. The sound was great for a large space. Seats were relatively comfortable but we didn't really sit much. Had some amazing roasted cinnamon cashews too. I would love to see more there!"  the location is great because theater parking is nearby and there are other parking garages around.  Same goes for places to eat drink before and after the movie." This venue is so beautiful I felt like I was sitting in the beauty and the beast castle. If anyone is looking for a special events venue I would definitely recommend this."  the costumes- beautiful...  My only complaint is the bathroom situation but with such an old & historic building- you gotta expect that.  What an awesome show.  My only question- why did I wait SO long to see this?  I think we'll make this one of our Christmas traditions."  huge beautiful chandeliers and  gorgeous ceilings. There was also a choir group who were singing christmas carols during the break! We sat at the center orchestra seats at row R This place is just beautiful! All the gold and intricate carved details on ceiling and walls is just breathtaking. "Let me just start off by saying: this place is beautiful. The bathrooms are clean and I love myself some theater. But they over charge for a lot of the shows. My last show was the cirque holiday dreams show. I payed a substantial amount of money for my seats and they were in the very back row of the first floor. Not only was the top of the stage cut off for us The missing star is for a strange layout.  The line to the bar at intermission blocked the path to the restroom  it was perfect. We will definitely be back to see other shows at this venue." First tier seats are great.  Don't be scared of them.  The front row has a ton of leg room and make for more comfortable experience for the long legged type. (Like me)" I've seen many performers and shows here. What an absolutely beautiful piece of history and architecture. In addition to the beauty of this theater is the fact that there truly isn't a bad seat in the house and the sound is always impeccable. We are so lucky to have the many theaters in Pittsburgh that we do. Last night was opening night for Shrek and it was so much fun. Brilliantly entertaining for the whole family. fHbgDvAsVDP51bGKgRlSoQ I love this gallery. It is a beautiful space. We saw a live musical event for first night.  though: the entrance area can get a little backed up pre-show (understandably)." "I got the chance to see the Nutcracker over the holidays at Blumenthal.  It was my first time there and I had a good time.  There is a lot of open space in the lobby with a little bar to the left of the ticket windows.  The center is very clean and they have some cool nordic looking wall paper in a strange minty green blue color.  A lot of shows and plays seem to come through here.  Garage parking is validated in the lobby  there is always some great entertainment at this venue in its several concert symphony halls. Highly recommend for dates and time with friends!" Bravo to this facility and their staff- they make a nice evening out just that much more enjoyable." It does everything I need an arts center to do !"  and Spirit Square. The shows are great and you can find some deals if you visit their website. I've never had a bad time at one of their performances. I did not have a good experience volunteering for them though but this is about Arts & Entertainment."  which trails only NYC in theatre production in North America.  They seem to offer a little something for everyone throughout the year."  it's nice because the parking lots are super close to the building but leaving after a show takes quite a long time. This place fills up my need for art and creativity in my life. So I'll be back to gawk at the pretty lights and lounge in a nice seat and enjoy a show here ASAP." I can only give NCBAP 4 5 stars because of the typical problem experienced when females visit most venues  that I will have to rethink the next time I come to the Belk Theater."  Belk Theater and the Stage Door Theatre. So far my only experiences have been at The Belk and Ovens Auditorium. Both were very good! Just for the fact alone that they provide the Charlotte community with such an amazing assortment of entertainment makes them a great organization! I always look forward to the Broadways Lights Series each Year. Sign up to receive emails and you will be sent alerts when new shows are added throughout the year; it happens frequently!!"  it should move very quickly. I estimate the ladies room can now accommodate upwards of 40 females at once. This was definitely past due. Now if the other venues will take action "Went to see Motown the Musical. Awesome! Wish it had been longer. The parking was good  which had 48 stalls. Having people direct patrons to stalls was immensely helpful and the line moved very swiftly. While there is an individual unisex restroom upstairs (we attended the Singing Christmas Tree on Sunday Very convenient to uptown restaurants and parking. If you park in BofA garage Park in Bank of America or 7th Street Station lots for only $5 with coupons sold in the lobby!  Great deal (especially when there is a competing event at Time Warner Arena and most of the lots are charging $10-20)."  I mean any theater with Alton brown is extra amazing." I've never actually seen a show here but took classes from Martin Thompson. Martin knows his stuff and I would recommend him for anyone who wants to break into acting. Decent wine and beer selections and prices.  Go to the website and hunt down the PWYC (Pay What You Can Night) and you can have the chance to see the show for a discount.  If you do this though remember it is first some first serve.  So get there early around 6:30pm and grab a number """Every Christmas Story Ever Told"" was slow and not that funny. Spoiled by comedy and improv options in bigger cities  comfortable place that really cares about being local and celebrating that.  They also have lots of fun shows Since then I've seen 39 Steps (hilarious... though I don't think that's the original intention) and Every Christmas Story Ever Told (not growing up in the US Because of the ease of this theatre I know I'll be back to see more. Keep an eye out on their website for new shows and specials. This is the perfect small theatre to support in Charlotte. Go arts!" I would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater."  so I just went and saw it for a second time because I know there were things I missed and I was right."  how many times can you go see Phantom?  Avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that ATC is putting together.  You won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons."  check out what's playing. It will definitely be worth your while."  amazing voices and just a feel good all around good time. These guys are pros!"  Mr. Randolph did a wonderful job.  I hope to see more from him.  I will definitely put this on my ""To Do List.""  ~" FK6qrsEbxZ0uTdho9rIWFQ The show itself was fun and well done.  I was impressed by the gusto of the cast and had a few laughs along the way.  I could tell there were still a few tweaks to be done to the show I will definitely be back!"  they have nights where ""Pay as you can"" -- definitely have to look into this one!" "" courtesy of Yelp Elite.  I have been a fan of Actor's Theatre for several years.  A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking.  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre.  Sometimes  I love this theatre. Great people work behind the scenes here and I'm happy to support the arts in Charlotte!" Actor's Theatre of Charlotte has the softest toilet paper of any public establishment in America.  the ladies bathroom... its big for a place so small.. seeing how the majority of us ladies ran to the bathroom during the intermission it was nice to see they considered the fact of a rush during the break. The bar had a good selection and decent prices  but most recently I have attended my friends' improv shows.  The theatre is very nice for a small venue.  The lobby is open and inviting with comfortable seats that make it easy to relax and converse before a show.  They have a small concession stand that sells soda  Vania and Spike! Great actors and actresses and the seats were great. Got there 15 minutes early and got the first row.  Samples aka Spike was a major hit!" We will definitely be back - we had a wonderful time and felt very welcomed."  there is wine and beer available in the lobby for a small price . The actor's are great and you leave feeling like you have just supported someone's dream to be a thespian."  you might want to get there early to get an amazingly good seat. There aren't any bad ones really since it's an intimate type theater  so any seat is the best in the house. Tickets are priced very reasonable and there are days during the run where they have a ""Pay what you can"" nite. Great for groups! They also have a bar (Full) & snacks. Special priced items on certain nights as well. Great place to experience awesome theater & musicals." "Great little theatre right next to Uptown. Fun shows like ""The Great American Trailer Park Christmas Musical"". A bit more edgy than your typical theatre This little theater gives big theater quality show! We just saw The Great American Trailer Park Christmas - Incredibly funny and well done. We will be back  puts on awesome shows. I went to an adults-only performance of ""Schoolhouse Rock Live!"" a while back. It was a really fun event. With the cost of the ticket "Wow! I think I enjoyed this as much if not more than my kids. We saw Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel based on the children's book. There is no bad seating in the Wells Fargo Theatre; it is small and intimate = every seat is a good seat! The production was about 50 minutes Take your kids to the plays.  Sign-up your kids for the classes.  You will not be disappointed."  Adam Burke relate that Jackie and Me is an important piece of theatre.  I really must emphatically agree.  How do you talk to your child about racism in a way that shows the true devastation?  Well The Children's Theatre of Charlotte didn't tell us "I love taking the family to these shows.  The performances are always top notch.  There are no bad seats and the tickets are really affordable!  When you are buying tickets for 4 people it can be pricey...the Children's theater makes it possible to share performance art with your children and not break the bank.  We make a day of it and ride the train godQP1tNTRvpuLUOQlUURQ  muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me." Perhaps my next visit will be to see the Charlotte Ballet itself!" Great performance! Not quite the same as seeing it every year growing up in NYC but pretty darn good! Amazing scenery (I wanted to eat all the candy in the second act) and quite a big cast of players dancers! They must have raided all the local dance schools for the ""cream of the crop"". So great to have something like this in Charlotte! Belk Theater was a perfect venue for them. Even though it was a very family oriented event  not the best performance but a holiday tradition acceptable." "Madison's great historic small concert venue.  Lot's of great bands play here.  I saw Weezer on their Pinkerton Tour with Nerf Herder (remember them? The Van Halen Song? Yes  Toots and the Maytals are just a few of the bands on the line up this month. It's a great place to see a band  the place has good acoustics and a nice setting for just about any kind of music or event you can imagine.  It is hard to believe that this place used to be a porn theater! Though I think that is part of the charm." "I love seeing shows at the Barrymore. There isn't a bad seat in the house and there's nothing better than strolling over there for a concert after dining at Monty's. This would be a five-star review  and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because Karen O. was swilling from a bottle of champagne "Great place for live music. Excellent selection of local beers on tap  good vibe.  Good bar selections.  They get a good diverse crowd."  it tends to get crowded very quickly  - and in general there is not assigned seating for the shows - so definitely show up early (before doors open) to get the best seats I love the Barrymore. I dig the vibe. I'm known to drive to Madison to see a show at the Barrymore even if the same band is playing the very next day at the Rave. It's a fact.  I like how laid back it is. I like the people who work there. I like the little plastic cups your beer comes in. I just plain like it. The Barrymore Theatre itself was not any better.  The ticket person was certainly less than a bowl of sunshine and I got in only to discover that they only took cash.  When a place only takes cash I usually vow to myself not return.  I think I am going to stick to that for this venue as well." If there's another artist that my husband and I want to see  history and proximity to my house are what I love about this place.  The drinks are slightly pricey but not crazy and the concert tickets are always reasonable-after just moving from Chicago I am astonished and happy as can be!  I would recommend coming here for a show anytime-plus there are several good restaurants bars around!"  I really do! No rail so front row is right on the stage. The ambiance here is great and there's some cool bars and restaurants to hang at before the show. Waiting for a reason to come back. (Umphrey's!)"  and decent acoustics but from the patron's point of view it is a pit.  The seats are cramped and uncomfortable.  The dance area is small and you get the hairy eyeball from the cranky front rowers if you want to groove.  I've seen them throw people out for even dancing a foot into the aisle...at John Hiatt!  If you end up in the balcony- give it up and go home.  Don't even want to mention the bathrooms  and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back)." f5ntGOT9_0pCdeUaUVi9cg "Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door "Came here for a concert and the security instantly assumed that I had been drinking which I had not. My friend was also hassled because he purchased his ticket online in advance and they were apparently unable to handle that transaction. Personally This theater has some really great acts and a good tap beer selection. The only reason I didn't give this old lovely theater five stars in that the theater itself could really use a lot of upgrades inside. I'm hoping that they follow in the Orpheum Theater's fashion and spend some decent money to bring this grad theater back to its original glory.  movie screen and the Wurlizer organ in the corner.  North of campus Older theatre but it still does the job! It's got a lot of character to it and sometimes you can see a pretty decent concert there!  and the right balance between older charm and current practical usability.  I'll definitely come again for a cheap flick.  Or maybe another bromance." The Virginia is also becoming Roger Ebert's personal project and he holds his film festival there every April. It's a great experience if you ever get the chance and the movies he picks are always awesome I hope the restoration puts the old (but not original) Marquee back in place so the lights and signage can be seen from down the street again." Really fun theater to go to.  A nice piece of history. "Lovely old theater -- so glad it's been restored and maintained! The staff is always courteous and helpful. A variety of shows is sure to please all types of community members! If you haven't seen the theater since the recent renovation  comfortable red plush seats and even the from the farthest of seats you have a decent view.  Not sure if it was just the production I saw I thought the acting was a little jilted in the production I saw... and I don't think it was due strictly to the British-affect the actors adopted." Thank you her-burger for a delightful venue."  sound and acting.  It's a wonderful venue to see wonderful performances."  he politely gave us our tickets and instead of us interrupting the people already seated he decided to put us in some empty balcony seats on the lower level. It was great! I never made it upstairs and mind you I was late but from what I saw and the staff being so helpful when I thought the night was totally ruined they get 5 star's from me!" And thanks Kym for the invite! I had such a great time!"  even told me to ""talk to the hand"". I kid you not. Oh. Parking you ask?  Across the street. I think we spent five bucks. I would most definitely return to the Herberger. I will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be. The art scattered about was enjoyable and the theatre itself was quite beautiful. Hopefully sometime soon the Pet Shop Boys will perform here. That's all I have..." I think that's about it.  It's a decent place.  I'd probably go back if they ever hosted a show I wanted to see.  Maybe some day I'll live in a city that actually has culture...and maybe that will be because of the Herberger." I'd like to come and see another show here to give the theater another shot  I had a good night out doing something different and seeing a great (& unique) show  everything is in old world proportions.  I'm talking like Fenway Park seating.  All the seats are extremely narrow and close together.  I guess that's what makes it so intimate!  The acoustics in here are quite good so it was very enjoyable to hear a show.  The staff was all friendly and helpful  I don't go to have a drink to a theater or a coffee "I saw ""The Glass Menagerie"" at Herberger Theater last night (3/27) and not only was the play great but the Herberger staff made the entire experience memorable. As a first-timer I appreciated the attention and thoughtful each theater-goer received. I'll definitely be back for ""The Second City Does Arizona  has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me  and the singers were full of energy and impressive. I remember coming here as a child with my parents to see other plays that came through Phx "I hadn't been to the Herberger in awhile and was pleasantly surprised at how good the balcony seating is.  The accousitcs were wonderful and except for the fact that literally one minute after the performance began there was a guy chomping on cough drops behind me We usually find pretty decent street parking given that it is downtown. There are also surrounding parking garages nearby as well."  I was excited to get the chance to see the world premier of Ten Chimneys here last night. We made the short walk over from dinner at the Arizona Center and I was really impressed with the venue. Super clean I would like to come and see another live performance here in the future. Judging by the size of the space "I am surprised I have not reviewed this theater.  I have been here for several performances by the Arizona Theater company.  The place is always spotless.  The attendants   but I enjoyed the theater and the performance.  I had a fantastic time watching Ten Chimneys "my wife and I went to see Sex and the Second City.  What a hilarious play!  We had a great time After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA  people can't conceive that such a show is available at such a time and such a place!  Best value in Theatre!!!" MANAGEMENT should not put  and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)" so it makes it so easy to see the performance very clearly.  Everyone that works here is very friendly. The attendants were very helpful..The bathrooms are very clean and automated.                                                                                        There is even a snack bar with consumer friendly prices. You make take your bottled water in the Theater with you as well.  We saw the show Daddy Long Legs This is the best place to watch theater in the Valley. No such thing as a bad seat. Acoustics are excellent. Small enough to feel intimate but big enough to not be confused with your neighbor's basement. I've enjoyed every performance I've seen here.  and after) are quite clean which is always a plus in my book. The staff were friendly and very helpful and I will have to check out the play roster for this theater to see what else may be coming up." If you like supporting local businesses & you love the theater Next time I will call to ask if the seats are the regular ones or the mini ones. I only noticed this problem in the first row balcony." If you'd like a hot appetizer during intermission  and on-street parking if you get there early. Also close to the light rail.  Great place to see a show." "Wife and I had the opportunity to attend a YELP event ! The show was called ""Circus Americana"". Seating was great  the only thing I wasn't impressed with was the seating  ages and interests.  Affordable and all seating is good seating - a rarity in theaters.   This is definitely a gem of Central Phoenix." "Very beautiful smallish theater. I enjoyed watching circus americana here and seeing there artwork. The boyfriend was not too impressed with the acoustics but I enjoyed seeing all that was capable with the space including use of large trampolines "I've always loved this theater. Big enough and still be intimate. There are no bad seats on the main floor. I love the feeling of grandeur once you enter this theater. I always feel like whatever I'm watching is going to be good otherwise it wouldn't be performing at the Herberger. I also love their location  but the balcony is really roomy and nice. The exterior is really pretty and old and full of character." "If you have been to the Chicago Theatre in downtown Chicago Illinois.....well this theatre....while not as big......would be Arizona's version. It is small....cozy....comfortable.....and very nostalgic. There is not a bad seat in the house and I was very surprised that I had not seen it before since I have spent sometime hanging around downtown. If your like me and go downtown for the sporting events and city center etc....this place could easily be missed. I went to a Yelp event there a couple of weeks ago which featured Circus Americana.....which is a family run and operated Circus....and it was awesome. If your looking for a huge venue to see a show then go to Chase Field or US Airways Arena.....however your looking for a nice intimate location well the Herberger Center is your spot. Eat  which kind of sucks. But it's better than nothing and is great for the theater goer on a shoestring budget. Add in the $3 parking validation for across the street Large facility. Nicely lit. Upstairs and downstairs...check it out. well worth a visit." Will definitely be back!"  it's hard to miss the glorious chandelier (pictured) under the atrium.  A theater wouldn't be complete without a bar area for drinks and snacks and HTC has got you covered.  The word ""Center"" in the title is no accident.  This facility does not have just one theater RA2EuX04SHqmayKpLhpNvA There were four ladies in our group and we all loved it! Go see it Great place to see a play.  small venue with no bad set.  Great plays.  it is your secret place for good theater in the middle of the city.  Other Desert Cities was one of my favorites.  well maintained and a nice relaxing place to enjoy a play." I'm sure I'll be back to see another show!" "For everything theater-related...you simply MUST check out the Herberger Theater Center in downtown Phoenix!  The have great community education classes  and this performance delivered talent far beyond my expectations!   WELL DONE!!    a MUST see show!!!  I will be back and am proud to tell all my friends and family to see it as well!   WOW!" Parking is hassle and expensive. Their website direct people to park at AZ Center which is further down on the other side of the street. It's better to park next to the theater or convention center."  the Herberger continues to be an amazing place to see world class performances. Check out the schedule Otherwise I love the setup and graduated steps so if someone in front of me is too tall  balcony and could not see any of the stage at all unless I scooted forward and leaned on the railing the entire performance. Everyone around me was complaining the the view of the stage was terrible because of the high railing. The usher was sweet and gracious and allowed us to move to empty seats in other areas but first row was no better anywhere. Apparently the architect never sat down to see if the stage was visible!" "We went and saw ""Fences"" with a 7th grade school group.  It appeared that a significant percentage of the patrons were from various schools.  I was a bit appalled when the actors were including mature themes in the play.  Humping the fence post  and even as a lay person it is clear that this place has no concept of how to adjust its acoustics for a non-classical concert. The bass is all too loud and the vocals sound like they are coming through a cheap mic in the open air. Ridiculous. Killed the night for me." I've never been her on my own accord (other than field trips) but I wouldn't miss the chance to come back." Hope to see you at a show sometime soon!"  but I urge you to get your tickets today. This is a show not to be missed!"  this is the perfect time to go... take the kids or go solo - you will not be disappointed!"  touching and insightful. Another great thought-provoking and entertaining offering from this top-notch company."  and a great cast making to work perfectly.. Make sure that you don't miss the chance to see them next year. Season tickets are surprisingly affordable. You'll be glad you went."  great performance. This is a must see for classic movie buffs. Lots of great behind the scenes tidbits. Susan Claassen was fantastic..." "Wow! Another amazing performance from Actors Theatre of Phoenix. Hunter Gatherers is a very captivating and thought provoking play that kept the audience involved all night long. It's these types of edgy rrXhjI4YXmWO8GbmX8oGqQ PS: This particular play is not suitable for kids."  announced that all of next season's productions will be at the Black Theatre Troupe at 1333 E. Washington Street. This will add consistency for the supporters." I will definitely see another play here!" "Saw Les Miz (5th or 6th time) and it was indeed something special in this truly wonderful theater with truly fantastic voices.  The staging was awesome I am excited to look into the Children's Theatre productions that are put on in the little Theatre. I know my 6 year old will enjoy it as much as I enjoy the adult productions."  the small stage was perfect for showcasings these gems. Tania  Katan is deserving of a purple heart for courage for her role as sole writer and performer of this fact based phenomenon. The theatre is small and intimate P.S. They announced that this was their 90th year  Phoenix is lucky to have a performing arts organization of this quality and I'd encourage anyone who likes live theater to be sure and check it out." Free and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting." Good parking for a downtown venue. I love walking in the sculpture garden of the art museum during intermission. They always put on very professional productions. Good parking.  Very professional I've been here a few times over the years.  Nice intimate theatre with really well done performances.  I was at Gypsy this Sunday and loved it. "I have been along with my friends to several events at this Theatre and every time it has been a pleasing experienced It was terrific in every aspect.  I had no idea there was such a reservoir of talent here - in every area of theatre.  not a bad seat in the house...." Glad to have this venue - and glad to see how many people support it locally - not a lot of empty seats at any performance I've been to!" I'm excited for this seasons performances! Especially RENT!!" This review is for the summer camp held here:  what can I say this was one of my child's favorite summer camps around Phoenix and we did a lot of them. The lion king production by these kids was excellent for one week of preparation.  They can't stop talking about this experience. "I have been to Phoenix Theatre a couple times to see shows in the large theatre. We went last weekend to their grand reopening The theatre make-over is great! I really enjoyed RENT. Look forward to the Black Box Theatre shows. Every seat is great and the tickets are reasonably priced!" We have been season ticket holders for years and there is no better season ticket in Arizona."  there is a small sign showing that the theater is further back and you have to zig.  Once there You can decide if that's an environment you'd like to go to for your entertainment."  with a snack bar (sandwiches a bit overpriced but reasonable pre-show drink prices) and a bar-bar for hanging out." Saw the Spouse Whisperer- Mark Cordes is hilarious.  Don't remember the last time I laughed so hard...." Not-one-to-leave-really-bad-reviews-often"  it would be Eponine (played brilliantly by Jenny Hintze). Her voice is amazing and my wife and I both loved her portrayal of Eponine. I see in her program bio that she has been in lots of productions and it is no wonder why. Thanks for a great first experience Phoenix Theatre A couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!  during after the show. The Almost Famous Theatre company puts on great productions in the Hardes theatre and its an affordable way to experience theatre and see local talent perform before they head off to Hollywood  I went to their magnificent bar which is in their front lobby.  I expected beer & wine however they had a pretty extensive specialty drink menu and quite a few beers to choose from - choices choices choices.  I ordered a Stella & the bartender said it was still Happy Hour - WHAT! Happy Hour HERE?  Yep it's true people - till 7pm if I'm not mistaken.  My beer was $3 - seriously.  For the intermission - I preordered my drink and a snack which was beautifully waiting for me mid show at the HAPPY HOUR PRICE.  I ordered a Devil's Kiss cocktail and a flourless chocolate chip chocolate cookie (thats A LOT of chocolate).  The cocktail was lovely & the cookie was HUGE & deeeeeelicious.  I could only have a few bites & it took me three days to eat the rest.  Now for the stage - it is not a large venue and the acoustics were very good.  I was in row E (left side of stage) 2nd seat from the aisle.  No obstructions and I could see everything.  I will definitely keep my eyes open for upcoming shows and visit here again.  LOVE a good show that doesn't break the bank!" We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away. Watched Pippin a while back and what a superb performanceThis small theatre is homey and quaintthe acoustics were not the best but the cast was amazingWould definitely visit for another play next time we find ourselves in Phoenix! "This is my second time to the Phoenix Theatre. The first time was watching Monty Python 2 years ago. I thought the cast did a pretty good job then. But most recently I went to see Mary Poppins. The show was fantastic! I was grinning ear to ear the entire time during the show.  It brought me back to my childhood. The entire cast was wonderful  which are good options for those who have hearing aids with telecoil or for those who do not have hearing aids. Message me if you have general questions with these type of devices. I would be happy to provide general information."  but they are unnecessary at this theater. It would've looked funny to use those for ""Debbie Does Dallas: The Musical"" though. Still  it sure isn't little anymore!  The new management has taken it from a cowtown community theater to a real professional venue with growth and expansion galore!  The addition of the black box theater is great but the seats are terrible.  The mainstage us as it always was and it is a nice little theater.  I have seen a lot of plays "We recently discovered this theatre and wish we found it sooner!  Been going quite regularly A very dissatisfied customer." X9ih9Iotd-VEZ8tTYfoarw My 7yr old even said it was beautiful the wizard of oz guys is the best cast and directors music composers there is ever! They out do Hollywood Broadway all that I loved it even better than the movie please go while you can!!!  if there is another play or musical that is interesting or arrives soon to The Phoenix Theatre It's always a good time! It definitely beats TV. Support the arts and have some fun. It's a great venue and small enough to feel very cozy. Sit near the front to feel close to the actors. There is some great talent. "What a Gem. This is the perfect venue for local theater. They even have a bar and resto  that is good!  Saw ""when you wish"" the Disney story and it was very good. Cannot wait to return to see more shows. Phoenix is fortunate to have such a wonderful venue!!"  and we especially liked the chicken club sandwich and kale salad. Prices were reasonable for food and drinks and we felt we had received good value for our money. But back to the people: Dixie wasn't merely acting in her role of a server: She was genuinely interested in making our experience perfect. It was obvious she enjoyed customers Do not hesitate to see some fun theatre and enjoy this space." Don't hesitate to come watch a play here!" I love this theatre! They have a great lounge area where you can purchase food & libations prior to the show starting. You're able to pre-order another round so that when you exit into the lounge during intermission your cocktail is waiting for you! The theater itself is small enough that you really can't have a bad seat. Downtown Phoenix and the other symphony venues also offer a variety of wonderful places to dine before or after the performance. The Phoenix Symphony website www.phoenixsymphony.org offers additional information  I'm on their mailing list and recently got a 48% off if you purchased tickets within 48 hours for Hocus Pocus.  I love a good deal!  One final note.  One of the musicians has an assist dog who is darn cute and had a pumpkin cape on last time.  How can you say no to that?"  best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!"  it's always nice to use this occasion to dress up my son a little so he knows we are going to some place special."  dancers and puppets. The event was family friendly and very well put together. there's not a bad seat in the house and the ushers were  VERY helpful. all in all  and the Texas Tenors so far  at this location and I have been pleased each time.  Great place to spend your Saturday night!" We promised to each other that we will come back in 15 years!!" If you are interested in having a sweet date night or simply looking to tickle your eardrums with outstanding ear vibes "Attended dress rehearsal for Maestro John Williams leading the Phoenix Symphony in advance of the concert tonight with Steven Spielberg.  It was 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning for the rehearsal and the PS staff and ushers were dressed up  you should especially bring one for your girlfriend who will inevitably get cold and take it."  now I know what the hell a Sugar Plum Fairy is too!!!"  the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it ""Beethoven Five"".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece I've had seats in both the lower and upper levels Great experience. I will definitely be back."  or after the concert. There are so many restaurants to choose from in the CityScape area." The Phoenix Symphony is a great way to sneak in a little culture and to experience one of the treasures of downtown Phoenix." "The Phoenix Symphony is full of good musicians.  I doubt they are given the time they need to really prepare the music with over 200 gigs a year.  As a musician myself I can hear it in their performances.  You can kind of tell the pieces they spend time on and the ones that are ""one and done"" in rehearsal.  I understand why There is always plenty going on at Phoenix Symphony Hall "Growing up in NY I had Lincoln Center and in AZ we have The Phoenix Symphony which is phenomenal!!!  Such an amazing group of talented musicians!  We have seen many many shows here and they are always super.  The acoustics are great  to hear yet another great concert." Attended last night at Symphony Hall and enjoyed it very much. I have heard this orchestra several times over the past 2 years and they are very good! Last night was  Bernstein with a violin soloist and the a Sibelius Symphony. Both were performed well. I did have trouble deciding who was over acting. The soloist or the concert master? Their body movements were way too much. I get it with the soloist but should not see that in the principle. We are fortunate to have such a fine orchestra here on Phoenix. "I have been to 4 shows this season now and everyone has been better than the last! I did honestly think I would be bored with the symphony but that was not the case! They have an amazing line up of unexpected entertainment. From Jason Alexander The concerts are always outstanding.  This is a great ensemble with a variety of musical offerings and conductors.  I always enjoy myself and have a great time.  No seat is a bad seat.  the symphony really are very talented individuals and the diversity of shows is amazing. Everything from classical symphony to amazing artists such as Jason Alexander. This is an excellent night out!" I will forever be a Classical music fan and thrilled to say that I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Symphony. Cheers***" Long story short: keep abreast of shows at Celebrity Theater. Good acts come around  we Celebrity you shouldn't sit in the first 5 rows.  You are RIGHT THERE and they can see you far too clearly." This place will definitely give you a night to remember." "Nice intimate venue for watching a show. Last saw Stephen Lynch perform here and was great. There is pretty easy access to beer My only beef with Celebrity is that they don't bring enough acts to Phoenix that would have me doing 15 cartwheels in excitement. But  and the band Manager emailed me back right away letting me know they would put me on the guest list for any concert I wanted to see them at." You will need atleast $5 for parking !" 3 accidents and a quick escape by the shear recklessness of my will did i manage to get out of the parking lot within 20 minutes. meh. i wasn't involved in those accidents thankfully...but i might of caused one of them hahaha. oh well. venue is pretty cool with the round stage that rotates..but the drink cost..stfu. i'm flaskin this place next time..or i'll tape a camelback to my inner thigh." Check out their website....find a show you want to see....buy tickets....go...and have a blast."  Dave Attell and Lisa Lampanelli here and all were great shows on account of the intimate arena-seating configuration. The circular design feels friendlier than the traditional ""square"" set up They recently dropped the fee for the parking went last nite to see the great george jones... first stop the will call window for my tickets i gave the guy my credit card  and drivers lic. he handed me 2 tickets and off we went i new i had ordered a isle seat and down near the stage when we were pointed to our seats they were up from the stage and in the middle........i told one of the ushers and he summond a manager/head usher i told him the situation and he took my name and said he would be right back he returned a few minutes later with the right tickets and apoligized..........great service.........when we did get the right seats we were behind the band........ my wife said oh great were behind the band then he informed us the stage rotates........cool...........great show......great venue... highly recomended   ALSO HAVE THER OWN PARKING LOT VERY CONVIENT PARKING....IN AND OUT "Celebrity is one of the better concert venues in the valley.  Sometimes the stage revolves and other times they do a 3/4 house show and it doesn't.  Either way I have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1"". Come on Celebrity Theatre Im sure its a great place to go see Celine Dion acoustic or something equally lame.  But why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me. I felt like i was in jail. Only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway." You're staring at the back of the equipment half the time!"  or Dodge. The ride back home consisted of singing Chris Isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down Washington back downtown. Minus the retard at the front door Ive been here many times and have seen many musicians and last I was here  but we got inside quickly. I love how small the venue is inside  the crowd was more entertaining. I can say that depending on who is performing I would not hesitate to go back to Celebrity Theater." The seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded. The beer was expensive (but that's to be expected at a concert)  Peabo Bryson ""Tonight I celebrate my love"" feat Roberta Flack (but on of his back up performed Roberta's part) & Jeffrey Osborn ""On the Wings of Love"". Truly it was one of the memorable concerts my wife and I have seen." I will not be back!!!" "This place was a pleasant surprise. It's the kind of theatre you want to go to if you want the warm intimate feeling with the performer. I attended the Kenny G concert here and his style of music was perfect to watch here .  Since its a small theatre  I still wouldn't hesitate to see an artist here."  assuming the engineer is half-decent."  and he was half naked less than half way through his set. That guy can put on a show that will keep you entertained through the entire thing. There was not one single boring section and he interacted very well with his audience. At one point in the show he even brought a girl on stage to assist him in undressing. He is a certified crowd pleaser. By the end of his act he had the whole crowd yelling his legendary chant ""Lace Up"". MGK made me proud to say I'm one of his ""EST soldiers"". I would definitely attend another one of his shows if given the opportunity.  If you are ever given a chance to see MGK in concert I would definitely say you should go. It was a great experience for me and I would do it all over again if I could."  and I would have to say this is my favorite. I'm from California so everytime I go to a concert it has been crazy expensive to sit up close and there are assigned seats (which I can't stand). Sure "I give this place two stars just because you have a great view of the entertainer your going to see here.  This Venue is nice because it's small and they do get some really good acts that pass through town here.  Other then that  and what was with the stage it is in bad need a of a face lift as well. I will go again because their are other concerts I want to see I gave them 3 our 5 stars.  (1 star for the theater itself & 2 stars for the incredible acts (Bob Weir Show.  (12/11/12)"  they misrepresented the stage layout. I bought two orchestra pit ""front row"" tickets. When we arrived we learned the stage rotates so we got to stare at the back of his head most of the show. Next came the awful annoying ""dancers""...people from the audience that had bad seats that decided to march themselves down to the front to stand right in front of the first row seats and completely obstruct our view. Security? Try fat overgrown meatheads...let me elaborate...when my wife politely asked the people ""dancing"" (more like drunk stumblers) to move so she could see the show always a nice smaller venue to watch a concert  but the venue is good.  I'd buy the tickets at the box office and save the money on the service charges.  It's a great small venue though."  not the best concert venue though.  The noise level gets really bad with the reverb."  but that didn't really take much away from the experience. The stage didn't revolve as was mentioned but Louis walked around so he was facing me much of the time it seemed...maybe cause the HBO cameras were near where I was sitting. After the show I walked to my car and was out of the lot immediately." This is a great place for a show.  The fact that it's a circular set-up means there are no bad seats.  Plus the drinks are great and the staff is very helpful.  I wish they sold more food here.  Also the line to get in was pretty lengthy.  Overall a good time. "I bought four tickets for the Louis C.K. show back in October in the orchestra pit . The date was rescheduled because he decided to film his HBO special there. That was all fine and dandy until I got the call from the theatre that he would be taking over my seat in the orchestra pit and that I would be relocated to an actual seat. Fine. Whatever. Third row is not so bad. Well when I got there I have always enjoyed myself here - but never as much as watching Louis CK record his HBO special last week. The only downside was the bars shutdown after he started (I'm assuming this was an attempt to keep people in their seats). The circular stage is unique and works well for comedy.  they can't get much better."  but the venue itself can't handle the number of people they can cram in there. There is always like a half hour of waiting in traffic just to get in to the parking lot  a cool place to see a show."  which makes it very easy to see the stage from any place in the theatre.  Loads of parking and really organized staff that makes getting in and out of the theatre easy to do.  Awesome place to see a show SvrmDNTTeOrM4XgnguERRA literally my favorite place to see a concert.  seating is a little tight but its worth it.  the setup is intimate making every seat a winner. BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA  the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!" "We went with a group of people to watch some fights. The venue is super cool with so much history it's crazy. I sadly do have complaints about it though. They are as follows: thanks for charging 5 dollars to park even though we bought tickets to your venue. Thanks for charging 15 dollars in additional fees so the ticket wasn't 35 it was 50 The Jackie Evancho promotors should be strung up for putting her in this filthy dump of a theatre.  Got an email ahead of performance today reminding us to allow time to be searched.  Really.  The Pearl & ascot crowd being searched!  For Jackie Evancho!  Saw BB King here.    Everyone was smoking e cigs.  Place was filled with smoke.  Wonderful.  Obviously terribly managed ! This place is an amazing venue! It's a theatre in the round with a stage that slowly turns! No matter where you sit you have a great seat! It's not CRAZY loud but sounds awesome!!!! Good bar. The only thing that sucked was only one girls bathroom! Lol! Can't wait to see what else is coming here! Just saw 3 Doors Down! Loved it! "Wow! Three doors down tonight was amazing! However having another person assaulting me three separate times was not.  A group of drunk rednecks sitting behind us made several people in the section that I was sitting in get up and leave completely. After being punched in the back of the head on three separate occasions I finally left as well. I informed security This was my first time at this venue and I was very glad to have been treated so well by the staff there  but perhaps for a boxing event or performer."  one of the better medium sized venues out here in Arizona to see your favorite artist up close before they book stadiums like US Airways and you have to see them on stage from a 100 yards away." Oh yeah. The venue is cool too."  I'd avoid this place.  If you must go "DO NOT ALLOW CELEBRITY TO SEAT YOU IN ROW B14.  I attended an event at Celebrity.  Bought tickets through Stub Hub.  I chose my own seat  in row B14 which looked like a good choice on the internet seating chart.  At the event I realized that  these seats are behind the Handicapped Section which is on almost the same level.  All you  could see were the backs of the handicapped people sitting in front of row B14.  Some people in Celebrity Theatre shirts said I had to stay in my assigned seat and couldn't move to vacant seats behind me (which remained vacant the entire show).  I asked the 2 handicapped guys in front of me  to scoot apart so I could see a small sliver of the stage and they did. When I complained to Stub Hub and the Celebrity Theatre a day or so later  small uncomfortable seats ... This place is obsolete.  Awful."  but only gave 4 of 5 stars because of your over price waters/soda's" I agree with other comments about drinks being excessively high priced.  It is a smaller venue that you may call charming in its 1970's style or outdated depending on how you look at it." PS: my seat was even held together with some tape and once we moved to a different seat in an empty row others took our lead and looked for something less confining."   it's claustrophobic.   My back was sore after 15 minutes.  I've sat in more comfortable seats on 25 year old Southwest Airlines jets.  Bleachers at Sun Devil Stadium were more comfortable.  I don't know if section A are any better." Came here for a boxing event and had a blast. I've been to many events here over the years and always had a great time! Horrible. The seats are dangerously small and lack room in front of them. I am 6'2 and I have bruises on both knees from having to wedge my knees into the back of the seats in front of me for Aziz Ansari. The entire two hours was miserable. Please please renovate the seating. Oofta. Will not return unless they host a must-see act." went last year.  Will never go again.  The only reason for the one star was the girlfriends I went with. I did like that every seat appears to be a good seat." Went there this past weekend for the Urban AZ Comedy Slam... This place is totally a rotten apple. It looks good on the outside but is totally ran down and ancient looking on the inside. This place needs a major update. The seats look so nasty you don't want to sit in them. Yuck! The show was funny as hell though. I wouldn't go to another event there.  you will be able to see any comedian or band that is on the stage. Be advised that some bathrooms are larger than others so the one closes to the entrance for woman is the one to go to during intermission as the wait will not be as long. (the other side of the venue I love how the stage rotates!  It makes it that every seat in the house is a good seat.  There were these really drunk rude girls in the next row trying to talk louder than Wynona was singing!  That always frustrates me!!!  Someone went and complained and they chilled out a bit and we continued to enjoy the concert. "This place is always a favorite because you can see some of your favorite artists for a reasonable price.  There is not a bad seat in this place because the seats surround the stage.  The bar service was great "This venerable theatre hosts some marvelous old-timers and up-and-comers for the Phoenix area. It's located in an industrial area near Sky Harbor Airport (no eateries nearby!) They sell water "What a dump. The sound was awful and my left leg fell asleep from being crammed into the back of the seat in front of me. Plus a $12.50 ""service"" charge on a $50 ticket  but left early because of how bad the sound was.  Like I said if you really like who/what you are about to see then by all means go to this venue and you will have a great time Plus they charge high prices for drinks Really enjoyed the Heart Concert last night! I give them 5 stars!!  The venue was a disappointment.  Had seats in the back row which generally would be fine but there was zero leg room.  I did figure out how to get up and down but it was tricky. The lack of restrooms was a big deal breaker for me. So no beer or drinks for me.  I guess some people don't mind that.  My daughter said there were only 3 stalls in the women's restroom.  I was excepting the sound system to be top notch but a bit distorted at times but ok with the slower softer songs were played. I know some love the revolving stage which I kind of liked also but when Nancy Wilson went into her solo at the beginning of Crazy on You all I saw was her back. Disappointed but I knew that could happen. Jealous of those who could see her going for it.  For paying $144 for 2 tickets and $10 for parking I expected an up to date venue. Over all glad I went because it was HEART. Don't think I would go to this venue again however.  is that the sound is inconsistent. I have been there on several occasions in which they had trouble with the sound and had to adjust it. It makes me wonder whether this is the responsibility of the venue or of the artist not having gone through a sound check. Either way Every seat is a great seat. So close to the revolving stage no matter where you are at. However didn't like the $10 parking fee. Sears are kind of confusing to find as they are not clearly marked.   I guess from reading other reviews they are not as tight as they have been in the past so that is good news too.  We saw Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons last night and enjoyed the show.  As I looked at my ticket stub today for four tickets we had a $5.00 order fee  although no lines at the show I went to (Franki Valli).  The seating rows were not marked at all.  Had to ask an usher.  On the plus side  but not so much that it's entirely miserable.  They also don't allow any writing implements in the venue.  This was a minor annoyance because it was cold out and we had to walk back to the car to empty our purses of pens Wonderful theater in the round setting. Definitely a good venue!! Went to see Keith Sweat in concert on 2/14/2016. The security could be tighter and have some control of various women who were trying & who got up on stage. A lot of angry people in the crowd over stupid stuff like that. Need to beef up the security other than walking the performances on and off stage. Definitely a great show but need more safety measures in place. I loved seeing Keith Sweat but not sure if I would return to their venue due to lack of security. "Were to start? We came to see Keith Sweat and Silk on Valentine's Day. Parking was $10 coming in. Not enough handicapped parking. People were taking up 2 parking spaces. Really. I was surprised when we walked into the celebrity. Wow we were already in the place. Lines for liquor were right there. All those people. The seats were on each other. We couldn't really stand to dance. As soon as I sat I started looking for the exits. Then the music system was horrible and static. Smh. Like it was reflecting off the tin roof. Not to mention the hoochie onstage that decided to get on all 4s with her behind all in our faces freaking the floor. I had to go to the bathroom. I'm still in shock. That bathroom is small  you could go to a local bar and listen to the recorded music for a lot less money...and the beer would probably be cheaper Staff is friendly and we always have a great time here."  don't go downstairs to the box office area 'cause you'll end up going through the bar area and then up the narrow staircase."  can't wait to see another good concert at the Celebrity Theater.  We had such a blast!"  I could've gotten a better seat. Since there's no refunds or anything So my wife and I went here to see one of our favorite bands last week.  The venue itself is a bit dated but I kinda dig the layout.  The bar downstairs is decorated with memorabilia from past guests and acts who've stopped through over the years which I thought was pretty cool.  The bar is limited in what they serve but they still have a nice variety and they don't get crazy with the pricing.  The actual theater is nice and it's hard to find a bad seat.  You may want to stay away from some of the seating that is closest to the front as the stage is a 360 rotating platform and their will be times where your view will be completely blocked unlike other seats.  The venue is very small and does not support a band with massive amounts of equipment.  Space is at a premium on stage.  The acoustics are not the greatest either  but overall I found this to be a fun and laid back place to see a show.  I'm not impressed with the audio in this ""in the round"" auditorium. This 50 year old concrete structure would be better off torn down so that it can be rebuilt with decent audio (and water fountains that meet current code)." BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA It was a disappointment - guess it's a great lesson After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay. The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set  and I have enjoyed better quality and better performances. I'm glad to see them growing and improving. I just wish public had more education and let them sing instead of interrupting every aria with applause." We will continue to support Arizona Opera and hope others do as well. The performances are outstanding. Keep up the good work!!!!" Just left early from Arizona Opera Lucia Di Lammermoor. It was horrible. I felt like I was at a high school production! Their is no sound production and the performers do not wear mikes. So you are in a fairly large hall (the symphony hall to be exact) and all you can hear are these tiny voices from the stage. I could've had the same experience watching it on my IPad. DO NOT waste your hard earned money. They should be ashamed to pretend this is a true opera!  don't miss this wonderful performance put on by the Arizona Opera. This was my first ""Lucia"" and it greatly surpassed my expectations. It is definitely an opera I would enjoy again. We are so fortunate to have this available to us here in Phoenix. We flew out to LA to see La Boheme a few months ago and my wife and I both agreed that LA Opera doesn't have anything over the Arizona Opera. Keep up the good work folks!" "I love going to the opera. I am always impressed with the vocal range of the performers. They can do amazing things with their voices! And the sets and costumes are so elaborate. That is the best part. Even though they are usually sung in a language that I don't understand The coffee/drink bars and the props from other shows in the lobby also provide good relief during the intermissions. The restrooms seem to move quicker than they do at other theaters in the area. Both times have been excellent and we will definitely return." "Bravo Tosca!  What a wonderful opera experience.  This was my first time at the opera.  I was thankful for the subtitles as the opera is in Italian.  The story of Tosca is timeless and entertaining.  Would like to have seen the cast ""act"" a little more.  The set design was very well done.  The orchestra was amazing and helped to keep the stage alive.  Looking forward to my next AZ Opera experience.  I am a fan!"  as otherwise I would be lost.  The acoustics in the Symphony Hall are awesome and my seats were smack dab in the middle of the room with the perfect view.  I like that you can bring your own bottled water and stuff too.  At least I think you can... no one stopped me or said anything.  I think it's awesome that we have this cultural experience in Phoenix!" "I attended ""La Boheme"" last night and it was beautiful. Gorgeous production - the performances "La Boheme  was excellent. For all we had to go through to see La Boheme in LA  (traffic) I will take AZ Opera any day. Symphony Hall is a much nicer venue than the LA Opera (smaller and more aisles!). If only the downtown restaurants like the ""Butcher"" were open on Sundays... We could include a nice lunch with a Sunday matinee. Opera has been enduring for a long time. It touches the soul. I wish we had more young people that were willing to give it a try. Support your AZ Opera. It's one of the best deals in town!" It was well worth getting all dappered up for the evening. One can't be too over dressed for a night out at the opera. The vocal talent was exceptional and no one missed a mark delivering the story. It was fantastic and I enjoyed meeting a few of the department directors. VIP? Yes please and thank you. If you want to have an entertaining evening you can't go wrong with the Arizona Opera. Bravo!!!" some of the audience will actually get ""into the act"" and play different characters to solve the crime).  It was absolutely hilarious and we can't wait to see another production! There were also several large groups who attended the same show and they were all talking about how much they loved it I have been to several of their productions and had a great time at every one.  They are professional quality and very funny.  Let you hair down and get an audience part if you can. I called Murder Ink Productions in search for a murder mystery party for my daughter. We booked the party a month in advance. I emailed him a script and had the party planned. Greg never showed or called:( we had to come up with 20 costumes in one day and my daughter ran her own murder mystery party. So disappointing ! I would not recommend this Company to anyone!!!! I called Murder Ink Productions in search for a murder mystery party for my daughters 13th birthday. We booked the party a month in advance. I emailed him a script and had the party planned. Greg never showed or called:( we had to come up with 20 costumes in one day and my daughter ran her own murder mystery party. So disappointing ! I would not recommend this Company to anyone!!!!  but Ballet Arizona has been a treat under Ib Anderson's direction.  I'm a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their Swan Lake and Giselle productions.  This year's season is ending BAZ is a 'must-see' every show." Prices are quite reasonable for what is offered.  There are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates.  Contact the box office abut that.  Another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization.  We work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like Ballet AZ blossom and grow." RCT5joZdjoJfEJOh7__x8A I will be the first to say I have not fit in with the new approach to volunteering at Ballet AZ and that portion of my life is ended.  I certainly am not saying not to check into it if you want to work with the Ballet.  I wrote my initial blurb almost a year ago. I really have considered whether it would sound like sour grapes by offering this new information.(That is not an approach I like to take if I can avoid it.) I have given out more information concerning Ballet AZ and volunteering as a result of my 1/29/2009 review. This is the only way i can think of to stay current and accurate for those who have gotten the information on a more personal basis." "My date and I attended the IB Anderson's Nutcracker last night.  I hadn't seen the Nutcracker since I was a little ballerina girl.  It was an absolutely AMAZING performance with stunning set changes.  The dancers were incredible and very fun to watch!  I would recommend this event to people of all ages as a ""Must see""." RCT5joZdjoJfEJOh7__x8A We also could not pass up buying the Angelina Ballerina book and doll at the gift store for our future little Ballerina."  you will still be happy with a trip to the ballet.  Ib Anderson really has continued making a name for himself with an incredibly fun version of the Nutcracker each year and brilliant performances by his lead dancers." RCT5joZdjoJfEJOh7__x8A  enjoying a special theatre treat in honour of their holiday. But there were also plenty of families there with young girls of all ages enthralled with the story - and the audience as a whole was happy to show moments of joy and laughter where the company xpected it!"  the costumes where amazing and beautiful. It really brings a bit of fantasy to your reality. My only complaint would be a crying baby and few ill behaved children. When you pay good money to go to a nice event Saw the Nutcracker for the first time this past holiday season and was blown away by the production values and the performances." Love the Arizona Ballet and their School of Ballet.  wow just beautiful to watch. Thank you Ballet Arizona for the beautiful performance! Look forward to seeing other productions in the future !" I felt classier just being in the audience. Thanks for a wonderful evening Overall a really stunning performance."  Lindsey and of course Ballet Arizona for treating us to such an amazing performance."  overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining."  excellent story telling. The female leads stole the show. They both did an amazing job and are excellent dancers. I had never been to the ballet before and will now return wanting more!" RCT5joZdjoJfEJOh7__x8A  hit this place up.  There are few places in America where you will see this environment.  Everyone is welcoming and nice "We always have a great time at Fiddler's Dream. Not your traditional coffee house ...Love ! Love! Love!" "in a non descript school house at a Quaker Church compound that's it's so easy to miss it unless you know of the place. Parking's tight with both private lot and a neighborhood street available. Walking in I love it when the old guys play they are amazing guitarists"  a vietnam era veteran. He carves his own flutes "Very disappointing all the way around. This place lost its soul sometime between my last visit 15 years ago and sept 2015. They had zero people in the audience
