FYI - Today there was an upright piano for $400 if anyone is so inclined." You should really go to the one on 20th St. & Indian School if you're in this area. They just built that one about a year and a half ago and it's clean and has great stuff." i get that thrift stores sell used stuff.  i do.  i get that.  but this stuff all seemed like it might be on its third or fourth go-round on the thrift store racks." I'm Sorry to say..But this store is just Nasty!!  even some that you don't mind re-finishing! There was not even a couple of nice basic pieces that I could take home and work with. I understand that some people might not have an option  you'll thank me later." So so if you are in the area stop but I. Wouldn't drive very far to get there... I didn't buy anything. 4/15/12 Teachers get a 25% discount on Sundays if you show your school id...oh...and seniors (55+) get the same discount on Tuesdays." Cons: Scary neighborhood." I'll come to this location instead." While if you like going to thrift stores for great deals you should totally come here."  the new location of this store is MUCHO BETTERO!  I go here a lot now and I love the new location!  Thank you for closing the old one and opening the new one!"  then they need to be in the back. I am avid Goodwill shopper and the caliber of individual working lately has gone downhill. Except at 16th street/Indian school - the employees are super nice there."
