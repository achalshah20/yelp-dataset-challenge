 they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image I will vehemently discourage others from using Corporate Office Centers as they are a complete rip-off. I have heard this tale of woe from others who were lured in and are now stuck. If you need an office space "My father and I started a Real estate brokerage about a year and half ago and took a leap of faith and moved our compnay to the Corporate Office Center on Shea.  Our experience here as been unbelievable. The entire staff including Dina Gibson the client service manager Regus bought out corporate office center. It is still an excellent office setting."
