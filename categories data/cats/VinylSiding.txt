My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them   few days later they were asking for 1092 for 1 window that was tested for lead out of 28 Windows they only tested one! They charged me 39 a window but only tested one I can't believe they changed there tune payed in full! I would never recommend them they should be ashamed of themselves ! They even called an attorney and didn't even give me a field report to tell me that each window was tested they assumed that if one window had lead that all 27 had it to and charged us for it! Never again!" My rating for this company is...don't choose them My rating for this company is...don't choose them
