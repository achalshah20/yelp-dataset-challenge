"I lived here for three years and in Barnard for my fourth (class of '02). It's a great place--centrally located  the staff at the front desk was very nice.  There is a dining hall but it's cafeteria food - I only ate there for breakfast since it was included  this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep It sure was excellent to have weekly (or was it every other week?) maid service. The private bathrooms made the decision easy for me
