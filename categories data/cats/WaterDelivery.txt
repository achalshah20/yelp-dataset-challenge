Had one issue that took three tries to fix although it was at their expense.  Yeah.  We loved that." Pretty disgusted with the service and the way I was treated.  Look somewhere else for your water softener needs." "I was contacting by Management at Culligan Total Water and they quickly resolved my issue.  I would still strongly discourage working with the salesman  they are way  overpriced. The prices they charge for replacement filters for the osmosis system are outrageous. The replacement cost for a new osmosis system was hundreds of dollars more than top of the line systems from other companies. Shop around  collections and upper management have all been fantastic.  We aspire to provide this level of customer service for our clients."  had a leak and was to be charged for a service call to tell me if under warranty or not. Contacted Culligan customer Service and Total Water did fix under warranty" Stopped in this afternoon to buy a refill for the five gallon jug I purchased from them. Customer service was Pitiful. Plan to return to doing business with Fox Water on Sherman Ave. even thou it is a little less convenient location wise. Owners are very nice. Place is clean. Way cheaper than water delivery. My kids like to go get Thrifty ice cream here. We come here to get alkaline water. Always tastes great. They also have various flavors of Thrifty ice cream for ice cream lovers. Inexpensive place to get your Chocolate Malted Crunch Thrifty Ice Cream fix.  Wish it was open later and on Sundays.
