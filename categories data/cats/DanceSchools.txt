 muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me." Perhaps my next visit will be to see the Charlotte Ballet itself!" Great performance! Not quite the same as seeing it every year growing up in NYC but pretty darn good! Amazing scenery (I wanted to eat all the candy in the second act) and quite a big cast of players dancers! They must have raided all the local dance schools for the ""cream of the crop"". So great to have something like this in Charlotte! Belk Theater was a perfect venue for them. Even though it was a very family oriented event  not the best performance but a holiday tradition acceptable."
