Visited the Mesa location. Dr Nguyen was great but his staff not so much. The nurse had to mention to my son that his sister was his half sister. That did not have to be stated at all! That's irrelevant. Now I have to explain to an 8 year old how and why his sister is a half sister. That is really unacceptable!!! My son has seen Dr Ritchey since birth. Everyday we are thankful that he came into our life.  We are confident with his abilities and consistently have seen his extraordinary care and dedication (to patients and parents as well!).  He honestly changed our lives!  and that has been planned out for a future date. I'm not looking forward to it TxbagW2dooKp_MIMQEAmpA  has been completely unresponsive to my requests to speak with her. I have been calling about once a week for a month and even tried and a fax and letter via snail mail but have yet to get any kind of response to my billing question. Unfortunately this experience has soured my overall view of the practice."
