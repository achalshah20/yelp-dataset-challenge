 and 7 ppl on the two basketball courts.  There is upstairs ""track"" which is more like a carpeted circle that goes around the gymnasium and a pool where they have classes.  Its smaller in size We were here on vacation and my daughter needed to train for a swim meet. It was only a 5.00 charge for her to get a day pass to use the pool. Everything was clean and new. The staff was very professional and friendly.  we are so glad they are here.  It has improved steadily over the years and they have unique programs for young people and seniors.  Hopefully the will expand the multi-purpose areas in the future.  overall My main favorite feature of this gym is the specialized childcare. My son had a bit of trouble letting go of me at first when I left him with the daycare area of the gym. However the childcare is so outstanding here at this YMCA in particular  the struggle is real in that department. I guess they don't believe that black folks swim since they only have 1 2 lanes available unless swim lessons are scheduled - it's a wrap."
