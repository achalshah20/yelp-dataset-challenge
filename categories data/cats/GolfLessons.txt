"27 holes and a nine hole par 3. Nice course This is a very nice course that is great for all levels of play."  make sure you tell them you didn't finish the fifth hole."  and the fact that he can share those rounds will get us on the course together and get him more practice.  I highly recommend Pleasant View for their kids' lessons - so far Great staff and you can't beat the location.  Excellent place to hold a party or other event."
