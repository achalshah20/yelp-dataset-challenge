 because it just struck me as juvenile.  The funny thing about this place is that there used to be a teacher (and I believe that he was one of the founders of the organization) here named Mr. Baxter and I recently spotted him in a spoof on Taekwondo called The Fist Foot Way filmed in Concord.  Wow  but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed. Most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students. Any attempt to voice the slightest bit of constructive critism is met with anger followed by bullying emails. If you want real martial arts This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids. "This is a good place to bring the little ones to see if they're interested. The instructors are gentle and helpful with all of the kids. They have an introductory special that gives the student a chance to try it out before committing. Apparently you can work all the way up to a black belt Thank you for changing my life!  and feel that I have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students!"  and the Zumba instructor is great!!! Keeps everybody on point during the session! I highly recommend!"
