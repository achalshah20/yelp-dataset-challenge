 and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie  I tried the soup and 1 2 sandwich combo.  The soup was delicious and it sure didn't taste canned.  The 1 2 chicken sandwich on rye was very fresh too.  Good  I figured they'd just have macros.  I ordered a 60 minute IPA and a double-decker corned beef pastrami Reuben.  The sandwich was amazing - fresh bread EDIT: :PERMANENTLY CLOSED" "I had it a few weeks ago while taking care of some business. I had the fried chicken and beef ribs. Excellent!!! For dessert I had the peach cobbler  and the wait time can be pretty lengthy depending on what u order..... im assuming the wait times are due to making each order fresh  the customer service upon entering and placing orders could be way better. Everything from the frustration expressed by the woman behind the counter (older This place piles sauce and toppings on a crust that can't support it.  you end up with a slide off mess.  Flimsy crap." [Cue the Tim & Eric ""Ya blew it!"" .gif.]" Wings are alright. The gyro is acceptable. The pizza is only slightly rubbery. Delivery however was speedy and service at the bowling alley was very nice and accomodating.  you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order (like Carolina's) "Been going to Red Devil for years.  Always know what you are going to get here.  Good Pizza I would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner. My colleagues and I have since fielded many requests from attendees and their parents for the name of the restaurant and we will continue to use them from now on whenever our convention is in the Phoenix area. Gratias vobis ago Go to Red Devil - what have you been waiting for?  Have some bruschetta.  Go home full." The Red Devil is overall a great place (perhaps can be considered a Phoenix institution) where you receive plenty of food at a decent price."  he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food."  and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you."  and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well The prices here are much too high for the quality  I had a HORRIBLE experience with the eggplant parmesan here.  It was just glops of cheese and really bitter eggplant.  One of the worst dishes I have ever eaten at any restaurant.  I'm not one to complain about my meals  and hopefully I'll be able to try it some day.. but Red Devil is probably equally as good when you're hungry for a slice."  stop by this wonderful gem of a restaurant.  Very close to the airport Been here once and it was really good.  Tried the eggplant parm and it was fantastic.  Hoping to go back to try other menu items including the pizza.  Service was pleasant and friendly and food arrived quickly. overall probably wouldn't come back."  but no amount of waitstaff attention can make up for the crap coming out of the kitchen.  There are so many better pizza restaurants around that there is no need to upset your stomach at this place."  there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer This is a valley icon/staple and has been around long before I was even a thought. Apparently we have some family history. This used to be my uncles college stomping groups and Tee Pee used to be my dads. Guess love of the local grease pits is hereditary."  so I guess I am not a white pizza girl. White pizza = cheese and oil olive. I love their classic pizza = cheese and tomato sauce. It was more than enough for lunch. YUM. The server was awesome  and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a ""slightly better quality school lunch burger"".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?" Good for cheap Italian food Tasty pizza. Reasonably good beer selection.  which actually looks good...they'll need to impress me quite a bit for me to ever actually suggest this place on my own."  and not taste like jarred tomatoes with no spice.  It almost seemed as if the joint had toned down the sause to ensure it would be more palatable to the masses.  There are much more delicious places in town  and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602 "You can either dine in or wait outside and order at the order window that is situated outside. While you waiting you can either get a drink at the bar inside or take a short walk to the other bar connected to the restaurant in the back. The waiter service is always great every time I have come here and we always sit in the back in the larger part of the restaurant. It is kinda divey in here as there are no windows "Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food Went to Red Devil with a few friends to experience their wings and pizza.  I was not impress with the food at all.  My friends liked it but for me the Pizza had a cardboard taste to it.  I'm from Chicago where Pizza is Pizza and this place did not do it for me.  Sorry! Great place to go and always great service!"  or the food there is sub-par. I will never know  which is just iceberg lettuce and few different veggies( probably bagged salad) this dressing makes it delicious. Our kids always enjoy the pizza as do we.  We figured out that when it's not busy we get better service and food. It's a bit of a drive for us but it is worth it." Lame. I'm not going back." People comes here mainly for pizza. SERIOUSLY!?? I stick to my Humble Pie. The rest of ""italian"" food seems overpriced and I had to take a look around to other tables to confirm I was not missing anything special. Improvement is a word they should review each day."  and the service was friendly and very prompt. Not in the best part of town with really good food. On this trip we got Pizza and wings to go. You call in and they have it  ready in 15 to 29 min. The pizza crust is really great. I always love their Pizza. It is one of the best  in the valley. We got 2 types of wings hot and BBQ. Both were fabulous! There is not a lot of parking in the lot because "Loving this place since 1991. It has been here since 1960 though.                    Always great food. They truly have the best Pizza in the Valley they still hand toss the crust.                                                                               Which makes a huge difference.   The wings are fab Pretty good Pizza & I am from NJ. I find the McDowell location substantially better than the north location due to the classic atmosphere and for some reason "This place is a good fall back place for my husband and me when we really don't want to have to think about what to do for dinner. Whether it is pizza or pasta dishes I love this pizza. It is one of my favorite pizzas in town. They are not close to me but I always make the drive to get it. What I love the most about it is the crust. I am a chewy yet crispy kind or crust gal. I love the chewyness of the crust. I love to get a side of ranch and a side of the hot wing sause and dip this pizza in. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. The wings are damn good too. I always get the hot cause I like the hot ones. They are fried not baked and taste oh so good. I have also had the bbq ones and they are tasty as well." "Hidden gem. The food is great - consistently! Classic Just ate here this week since I was visiting Arizona  regardless of the toppings. Wings are good  there is a $5 off coupon on their website.  $5 off any order of $30 or more (so get it before it expires)." So if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you!" I'm headed back here next time I'm in town with my kid so she can check out where grandpa used to take mommy. I love it when places  have been  around longer than I have been."  and comfortable atmosphere. The prices are reasonable."  seemed upset. He took several opportunities to walk past our table and either ignore us (to see if we would like more water) or to glare at us. I found that unprofessional and odd. I guess he was expecting more? Either way  I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food." "My husband and I LOVE Red Devil. We eat Ina few times a month and order take out at least twice a week. Red Devil never fails to deliver an excellent meal. We generally eat dinner late (after 8pm) so we rarely wait for a table. Dinner hours expect a wait The room is barely decorated and unmemorable.  We got there at 5 on a Sunday and the place was packed full.  My party of 8 was squished uncomfortably into a table against the wall.  It must be noted our server was extremely nice  and one more Yes. I have now been there 3 times. pizza is a thinner crust. We always get the Greek salad along with a pizza. The prices are also reasonable. They get really busy though "Ordered a large pie for carry out took less than 20 minutes.  Service was great.  I love the crust because it's got a little chew to it and it was thin and crisp.  I would go again try the dine in menu. I loved what I ordered pepperoni I was just recently introduced to this place and I am addicted. They have the best wings and ranch sauce! I also was a fan of the pizza. If you are not into eating in the restaurant they have a super easy pick up window and you get to watch the guys make the pizza while you wait. The only thing that sucks about this place is the parking. However it is good when you see a ton of cars in the parking lot you know you are in for a treat. I have not had any pasta but will be trying it soon. This is my FAVORITE pizza in the world!!  but not for a specialty pizza. I brought the pizza home and unfortunately it was on the cold side (always a hazard when picking up a pizza) and they didn't include any crushed red pepper in the box (I guess I should have asked). Anyway These guys are going on my Pizza LIST." Only thing that sucks about Red Devil - The Parking Lot." be in ...  At the end of our meal I asked for the check and it was for OVER THIRTY- FIVE DOLLARS for ONE PIZZA With TWO TOPPINGS  And TWENTY WINGS and ONE Soda ..... As I looked at our check I mentioned to my friend "" no wonder the place is empty."" Back in the day this place was packed and all I Know there are many other choices out there to spend thirty-five dollars for pizza and wings .... Oh by the way that Thirty-five dollars DIDN'T include the tip for our server ......."  but not damn near as incredible as their version of the pizookie! I had a friend who wanted to make a baby with the cheesecake and their brownie with ice cream was respectable. Save room for dessert here...and just get the pizookie! Yum!"  and ordered the same thing-loving it every time.  It is the Sicilian Pasta.  Do yourself a favor and try it.  Delicious chicken and pasta "We wanted some quick take out and decided to hit up Red Devil las night.  We got a sausage pizza togo.  Honestly it was just ok Definitely will be back." Wings were tasty! Pizza sauce had great flavor! Worth trying. May I suggest pan searing the chicken and rethinking the sauce...just saying"  and my little picky eater who never likes anything other than cheese pizza said she wants the meatball and olive pizza again.  High praise."  seldom do I have to ask for a refill or other item.  This makes Red Devil a must for our birthdays  but he still found room to steal about half of my salad off my plate too!" Just really not what i have come to expect." "This restaurant meets and exceeds expectations in flavor  however my boyfriend wanted to try it so I went with him. All I can say is this place has the best pizza and wings I have had in Phoenix. Great prices  right down to the old-school arcade game in the corner. And the pizza tastes the same too. And while it's still very good This restaurant also does well balancing the ""family friendly"" with the ""date night"" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes I shalllllll come back." This is just a great local spot." Oh man what can I say!! This place is the bomb!! It's nothing compared to the location in the West side of town (where I live). My Bf is tired of this place since I want to come at least three times a month. Who can get tired of Red Devil's...right. The pizza has a thin delicious crispy crust and the wings (extra crispy please) are a home run. I've also tired the pasta but always come back for the pizza and wing's. Oh and yes they have Pepsi!!!! "My husband and I recently moved to the area and we were looking to try a new place.  I came across this place while looking at yelp reviews.  On a Saturday night my husband and I went to try this place.  We were really impressed they had a to go window so we didn't have to go inside to order.  We ordered a pizza with half cheese and the other half had sausage "I would recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza and wings. Price is pretty good "I love this place. Wish we had one in Houston. I go every time I visit phx. Large with Xtra sauce  the impression was that everything was just good ... Nothing great that you'd rave about to friends & family but nothing bad either; we're undecided whether or not we'd go back." Overall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it." pizza and wings. They have a pizza and wings special for $26 and it's the BEST pizza in town. I've been to the other locations but for some reason the pizza and wings taste best here. I live in the far west valley and I make the trip all the way to east Phoenix to enjoy their pizza. If you're ever in the area I would recommend the pizza and wings special to anyone."  and on nearly every visit I grab a pie from Red Devil.  The pizza is delicious and the guy at the window taking money is one of the nicest guys! Every time we go here and pick up our pizza he had a huge grin on his face.  I comment about how polite he is each time!  This place is to die for - gotta check them out!" Best pizza around my Phoenix area" The lunch specials here are great. I think it was about $7.50 before tax for two slices of pepperoni pizza and 5 or 6 wings. It's good old-fashioned comfort food. Great food and a good family atmosphere. Too bad they don't open on Sundays. I would imagine that Sundays could be one the most profitable days so I don't understand the concept behind it.  paid and left! She NEVER once apologized and she kept making excuses as to why it took so long- oven was way in the back and there were a lot of catering orders! Anyways if she would have just told us the truth-that she or cook forgot it  we would have left happy customers but that's what makes the difference between a good waitress and a bad one! Still love your pizza! Hated our experience tonight! We did give her a ""written"" tip and maybe this won't happen again!!!" Them to correct the mistakes of their employee.  I hope our waitress can at least learn to say ""sorry"" when mistakes happen next time." I will never eat at red devils on 31st street and McDowell!!! First of the roach on my pizza and to top it off my drink had a long hair in it this place is gross and would not let a dog eat that garbage.  the Red Devil in Tempe does not make pizza that tastes this good (different ovens? sauce?).  The take-out orders for pizza here are relentless too  and I thought the Penned w Meat sauce was excellent.  I'll definitely make the trip from N Glendale and eat here again."  other than that I can cook much much better than this at home & for a fraction of the cost"  ""Danny"" and is completely a management problem. In all reality I thought he was the dishwasher. Nothing about this young man says management My mom said her clam chowder was ""all right"" which usually means it was okay but she wouldn't get it again.  HER salad was okay "I have been eating here for over 38 years and I have never been disappointed. The service continues to be excellent and the pizza is 2nd to none! Whether you're ordering out  or any other commercial mass produced pizza chains. I actually ate the pizza for the first time up in pine top lakeside in northeastern arizona and been hooked ever since. It's above average. See if it's for you" "Red Devil on 32nd street and McDowell is my favorite restaurant of all time.  I've tried almost everything on the menu since I've started visiting (1983).  Being born and raised here in Phoenix why my family never brought me here as a kid  if not more).  There's an enormous selection of quality Italian restaurants north of here that I would recommend The pizza was better than expected and I was surprised it was as flavorful and fresh as I remembered. I guess I shouldn't be "Oh nice! Fresh crispy pizzza . Fresh out of the oven ( homemade ) like. 2$ IPA PALE ALE. Service is friendly   however the environment was nothing short of a zoo. The staff did nothing but laugh scream and flirt. Never was asked how the food was only did you want anything else because we are closing. I would have asked to speak with the manager however the manager was involved in the party as well from flirting with the employees to hugging on them. I smell a lawsuit in the making. I would recommend the food just get it to go." Good food horrible service our waitress's was super slow and on something very not all there "Been coming to Red Devil for 30 yrs. best Pizza in the Valley of the Sun!  I also love the Chicken Romano w/ the garlic oil This is my all time favorite place for pizza and wings. The wings are crispy but still have a great sauce and the pizza is New York style awesome. I could eat here every week and never get tired of it.  delicious and quick. LOVE IT. Don't have patience for any other pizza joint anymore not when I found a slice of heaven" We had 20 mild BBQ wings and the large salad. Everything was awesome! You can't beat the great service from Debbie either. She is by far the best waitress we've experienced in a long time! So refreshing! Thanks and we'll be back!!!  and ranch! Have been going here since I was little. Will forever be my favorite place! Good for dine -in or take out! Also this is the only good location in my opinion  and damned if it wasn't microwaved! I SENT IT BACK! My granddaughter had the cheese ravioli and the marinara sauce was inedible. The wife had shrimp alfredo and it was passable. The best thing we had was the antipasto  and artichoke hearts and it was superb! Even cold! Take out guys were very friendly and accurate." Some of the best wings I've ever had in the valley. Also ordered a pizza which turned out to be very good as well. The crust is very fluffy and just a couple of slices and you will be filled.  nothing short of your neighborhood Italian restaurant. They could use a remodel inside. Service is always with a smile and food comes to your table in a timely manner. If you are visiting this place on a Friday or Saturday evening PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng I think I'll stick to pizza from this place and leave the dining alone." Visited September 2015" I promise you won't be disappointed at Red Devil!"  and I haven't tried them but I have heard their meatballs are something to write home about :). Awesome establishment." I bring all my friends from the Midwestern states to try this place and most want to eat here again as long as I don't go along. I guess they like the PIzza better than my company and my wife doesn't blame them!" "Great place for old school pizza and wings.  Bare bones restaurant in dire need of updating  etc... Lot's of Italian comfort food to choose from on the menu. This is my favorite place for wings!" Wonderful Pizza !! Great Selection of Wines and Beer !!! Pretty extensive menu and Great Comfortable Setting !!! "I have been going to this restaurant for over 30 years. I still think that they have the best pizza and also have a great Italian menu to choose from. From manicotti I have eaten at this location 1 time i dont know if it was time of day but had an Italian beef sandwich threw up for two days not good  small is big enough for 2-3 people) is pretty plain but the house made italian and bleu cheese is great and then there's the pizza. I've tried a hell of a lot of pizza and this is definitely up there in the top 5. Seriously I was introduce to this place a few years ago by a friend of mine. Since then I've eaten there quite a few times and pizza is not the only thing they serve. There pasta dishes are excellent too!   but try to make the trek across town to enjoy this authentic Italian restaurant." This is the best pizza that I've had in town. Consistently good for 40 plus years. Salad is also super yummy. The bread is to die for good also. Never anything but good food. The pizza and wing deal is not on the menu but they do offer it! It's a must when I come here! "I live close by this location and I've been wanting to try it for the longest time so yesterday I did and it was a waste of money. I purchased the Philly Steak Sub and it was all bread It was just a bad overall experience. Do NOT go here."  sometimes bordering on rude. But pizza and wings make up for it. Sometimes a long wait. If they could get a manager who knows how to train and supervise staff Great Phx original! Wonderful pizza & Italian food. A must try & great to go window. Several locations but McDowell is the orig. We went for our anniversary lunch . It was so good . I had the stuffed manicotti hubby had spaghetti . Calamari as our appetiter. It was cooked well not rubbery at all . Service was good and yes we took home cheesecake with strawberries. Soooo good .  I can't believe I have never ben here before! The place was packed which is always a good sign. We only waited like 5 minutes on a Saturday night before we were seated. We ordered the boneless wings which weren't anything spectacular First time at red devil tried the combo pizza and was impressed. Middle was a bit soggy but I guess that's to be expected with so many toppings. Flavor was spot on. "On 4/13/16 I and my family went there for a bday dinner. It was busy n we waited 45 minutes roughly. Half appetizers came out and we waited for other half of appetizers. The kids food came out within four minutes and still waiting for appetizers. They were three other tables that got their food before ours and were there before them. I want to talk to the manager in the server and inform the server that this time would affect their tip. Finally our food came out n the manager gave us 25% off. We are very upset with the service  my friend and I started by knocking out an order of 10 wings coated in their medium NY sauce. I had to ask our waitress what the sauce was made of because it was that good. She stated the sauce is a combo of hot sauce  especially if the sauce for entrees is just as sweet. It was just ok to me and not a place I would go out of my way to head to." This is where u wanna go when u want to meet up with all your family and pay for the tab lol it's cool and really good wings The reviews on this place are pretty high so I was excited to check it out. I ordered a pizza and a calzone. Both were decent but nothing too exciting. I'd be interested to try them for dinner and see how their pasta and other dishes are. For dinner take-out I ordered the Chicken Lasagna. It was amazing!!! So much flavor & right out the oven. The parking lot was packed so the dining experience must be good; I'll have to dine in next time.  but it has good sauce the crust isn't crispy hard thin. More like NY or Boston style. The ambiance is a bit old school  quick and a well done crust. Hold the ranch ya jabronies!" "We ordered a large pizza and hot wings. The pizza was too salty but the wings were delicious. We ordered out so cant say much about the service. They are pretty pricy$$$$ Just fair food.  Just fair service.  Nothing special...I would skip it.
