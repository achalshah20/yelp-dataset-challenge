I would totally stay here again." The sitting area in the lobby was a happening place and very relaxing to kick it and watch sports. Nice place." I recently spoke with the manager regarding extended stays at this location and he provided a tour of the facilities and a couple rooms. I'm extremely impressed with the service and facilities and plan to go here for future visits while in the Madison area.  I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided." I hope this helps all the dog lovers out there.  :)" Until my next stay..."  and definitely go to the live band at the Capital Brewery a block away on Friday night.  Fantastic place to walk and just enjoy the ambiance of a great little town.  Oh "Better than we expected. Had never stayed at a Staybridge before but decided to since we are IHG rewards members. Free upgrade to a two room suite with my membership. Staff very nice. Room was spacious and very clean. Nice  which means you get to know the staff really well. Everyone is super nice and helpful. I especially love the complimentary breakfast and their ""socials."""  the full kitchen is very helpful.  I loved the wheel chair accessible room because the shower helped my sister get in and out (she has a disability and needs assistance in the shower).  The free bfast was delicious and plentiful Thank You to all the staff !" Amazing service.  Staff goes out of your way to make your experience a memorable one.  Shuttled my group to and from the Badger game.  Walked downtown Middleton from hotel and had a great time!  This will be our main place to stay next time we visit. Front desk and service were top notch!" All in all an ok stay but no accolades to offer.  Meets the need."
