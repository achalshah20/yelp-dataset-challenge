"Can you review water?  I think so.  I hope so since we're mostly made up of water and so is the Earth.  Great price I go out of my way to come here and each time I go to fill my water bottles The shaved ice is amazing!  They have every flavor you can imagine!!!  Outstanding! I've been getting my water here for years. Great water and great service. Also sell other products like shower filters. Love the shaved ice! Lemon and cotton candy are my favorite! The friendly staff make every visit enjoyable. Being an animal lover and a shaved ice lover - this place gets FIVE stars."  none of that scary artificial stuff. Denise was very friendly and welcoming. She actually takes the time to shave the ice and is not stingy with the flavoring. As I waited around I noticed the different water bottles from liters to gallons. One caught my eye of course OuRFI9c8s73i9whoTApxdQ The best water ever!!!!!!!!! Plus when you go in there you are  like family . Denise is wonderful you get to see the dog and you just feel warm and loved . The service at water connection is fantabulous! All of the workers are so nice!The sour spray is sooo good. I do recommend this an afternoon snack!Have Fun! Love this place!! I have been going there since I moved to the neighborhood about 10 years ago.They have the best Hawaiian shaved ice in AZ. Owners are very nice. Place is clean. Way cheaper than water delivery. My kids like to go get Thrifty ice cream here. We come here to get alkaline water. Always tastes great. They also have various flavors of Thrifty ice cream for ice cream lovers. Inexpensive place to get your Chocolate Malted Crunch Thrifty Ice Cream fix.  Wish it was open later and on Sundays.
