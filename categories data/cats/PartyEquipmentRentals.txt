Finding that party & decor rental can be really easy and really affordable made me realized how to turn a party into a real event for everyone to enjoy."  I forgot to finalize the contract until just a few days before I was supposed to pick up the linens! I certainly don't recommend this approach but everything worked out just fine despite my terrible procrastination. The linens were the perfect touch to set off our flowers and other decor I have two more events coming up! I look forward to working with Party Reflections again soon"
