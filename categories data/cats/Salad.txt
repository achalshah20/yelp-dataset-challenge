Can you enjoy a meal there?  Sure.  Would I suggest putting this into the regular rotation?  Most likely no."  if you are just looking for a tasty salad "Souper Salad...Soup or Salad! Now I don't feel completely secure eating at a communal salad bar. You never know who has been there before you or how long the food has been out. That said sometimes you just have the hunger for a salad bar experience The pizza wasn't great...the pasta could have been better...and the fact that you couldn't refill your own drinks (like at Sweet Tomatoes) was also a huge problem for me. Now the price i have to admit was unmatched...i would go to this establishment again for that reason alone. My wife and i only paid 13.29 for the both of us to enjoy the buffet...just wish there had been more choices but for the money it was not terrible. So if you are looking to eat healthy and are looking for a cheaper alternative to Sweet Tomatoes...then this is your locale. Eat  I don't think the soda should be an additional cost."
