It's just a nice hidden gem if you are looking for a place where people still walk around and pay attention to each other.  Where you can be as active or sedate as you want to and be assured of a caring staff and neighbors." "This place is amazing! We searched all over the greater Phoenix area to look for a place to settle in. The view is spectacular! Surrounded by mountains and the sunset are breathtaking. Very close to highways so it's easy to get anywhere. You don't feel like you're in the city. The people here are very friendly. There's lots of activities to keep us busy. There is a beautiful heated pool Its up side you do have security gates and the view is beautiful." The negative experience of having to live in a construction zone is hazardous to even healthy lungs let alone senior ones.  In my opinion the owners of this park is subjecting themselves to law suits because of insufficient warning of when construction action is to be done. I hold the park responsible for any breathing issues or hospital costs that might be incurred as I was not given sufficient notice to vacate the premises. If I could not have been out of here by Oct I wanted to vacate the premises and in order to do that I expected the courtesy of at least a week or two notice prior to the actual digging. Is this any way to run a community?"
