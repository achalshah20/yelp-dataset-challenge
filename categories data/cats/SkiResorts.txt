The staff is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about skiing. Considering we're in Phoenix  I wish they had a bigger selection of larger-size men's gloves. It took a few minutes to dig out a pair of XLs that I liked. Most of the gloves were in the S to M size range. Looked like they had a good selection of skis/boots/etc... Staff was very friendly and helpful."  nice tune & wax.  Been coming here for a few years." I get my skis worked on here regularly.  They do a great job and always friendly and helpful.   My buddy bought some boots and took them back a couple times for fitting adjustments (normal when you get good boots) and they worked with him until they were perfect.  Quality shop for sure.  once I ride these I will be in a good position to make a decision on which skis I want to buy  so I know good advice when I hear it -- and I appreciate it when the salesman convinces me NOT to spend more money than I need to. (Bonus points for spending so much time with my feet on a 90-degree day... patience of a saint.) Best of all super nice guys and very helpful. nice shop too with tons of options  they knew what they were talking about (which is great because I did not) and they were nice guys. I'd happily spend my money here any day. Thanks This place is a far cry from what it used to be. It used to be a lot bigger with much more selection. I walked in and the store looked half empty. The selection was dreadful. A few things here and there but nothing really like the other shops in town. I mean I know it's Phoenix but there are much better choices out there. Save yourself a trip and go to ski pro.  even if it's just to buy a pair of snowboarding socks and say hi to these guys. They treat you like family. I highly recommend them."
