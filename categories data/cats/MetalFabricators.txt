I needed a small thin metal bar welded for my exercise bike.  I dropped the part off to his home and left it with wife.  Next day picked it up with a very good price.  This is a good welder and service near N. Phoenix.  called him on aSaturday afternoon and he was at my home to do a welding job within  two hours. Work was done well and at a very reasonable cost. I would definite use him again"  hire this man and he will not disappoint!  Thank you woody!" I highly Recommend Woody!"  solid work at a reasonable price. Had a custom dog gate fabricated by Woody... now the door jambs may be gone
