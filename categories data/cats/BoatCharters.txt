"We have had a terrible customer service experience with this place. The sales is experience was fine "Horrible service. They are a complete abomination and I should report them to the Better Business Bureau for their lies. They have had our boat twice in the last three weeks 8O9iXCjE6WNz2am2YechBg My only suggestion is to allow 6 hour rentals. The half day (4 hours) goes by so quickly but the full day (8 hours) is way too much."  they found the gas leak.  The motor had a leak and was covered under warranty.  We were told it would be repaired the next day. It is now a week later (for a total of 4 weeks that they have had our boat) and several more messages have gone unreturned.  My husband has stopped in several times and they won't tell him anything other than our boat is not repaired yet.  With a service manager who doesn't care about the customers "I am writing this while I sit at their parking lot waiting for my boat to be put on a trailer from the dry dock. I called yesterday morning and requested to have my boat pulled from the dry dock and was told that it will be ready today at 1 pm. I came out here at 2 pm thinking it will be ready for pick up. I looked around and my boat was nowhere to be found. I asked the lady at the service department and I was told that it will take 20 mins for them to grab my trailer across the street. I've been sitting here for and hour and a half now and nothing. I walked in there again and asked the same lady and she had already forgotten about me. She comes back and tells me that the first guy they sent could not find my trailer and they have another guy go grab it (I actually just saw my trailer pull in). I wouldn't be this upset if I didn't feel like ""another customer""to them. See
