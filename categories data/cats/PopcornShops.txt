I found these guys while looking for an affordable supplier for popcorn for an outdoor party. I had a tough time deciding what flavors to get. Individual red stripped bags were included for guests to fill and refill with the various flavors. The popcorn was very good and was a HUGE hit. People are still talking about what a wonderful addition it was to the backyard movie   party. Will be using them again this year. Great service and selection. Have used Munchees several times for party supplies.
