This is a great little mailing shop that is conveniently located in Shadyside.  They do charge a little bit more than the post-office (I think 10%) but it is worth it.  The owner is usually there and is helpful.  It is never crowded so they can help you figure out the best way to send something.  I like that they even have some old post-cards of Pittsburgh.  but it's great when you're in the neighborhood and or need to ship from multiple carriers. And it's usually a quick stop. They've even come to pick up some unwieldy boxes from my workplace to send out. A+!" They are amazing!. I have been renting a mailbox here for over a year. The staff is super helpful and really nice. They provide all services and their pricing is fair. "I needed to ship a pre-labeled UPS package but couldn't find a UPS store in Shadyside. Or a post office. Or a Fed Ex. Why?! I was pretty peeved until I searched for a UPS authorized retailer and found that this place was right off of Walnut. Yes! I can walk to it! I dropped my package off for UPS pickup This business closed July 31st 2014!!  maybe just a tad too nice.  You know like a waiter that swings by every 5 seconds to see how the meal is.  I'll take that issue any day of the week though." xSgactTrgrMqN6bO4_NitA Best customer service ever! They helped me get a rush order in and when I messed up the paperweight for printing they fixed it for me! Thank you guys!!!! :)  I could forwarded it from my phone to my customer. They need to have a app for that! I would have pay extra for the service. Other than that it was a great experience."  be sure to check the drop-off times... for ground shipping I think it's 6pm.  Lots of computer workstations to access the internet or finish up work - the store is usually pretty quiet aside from the people coming and going xSgactTrgrMqN6bO4_NitA This Fedex location has it figured out. Ordering complex documents from them is so easy.  They are very accommodating and do it with a very pleasant and welcoming attitude.  Consistently first class customer service and they know printing.  FedEx pulls through!  The quality is very consistent.  I can order online or via email  all you Plaza Midwood peeps and Elizabeth residents have a quick and easy ship shop on Hawthorne. Parking is a cinch and there are plenty of greeting cards The thing that sets it apart is the customer service. Each of the guys that work here are fantastic. It's not that much to shake a stick at  and the UPS Store was the official outlet for doing so.  The lady who helped me was polite and helpful.  Goddess bless her; it was the end of what probably was a long and aggravating day dealing with people's stuff and a thousand dumb questions.  She remained patient with my obvious unpreparedness for shipping the items in my possession.  But the real reason that I am giving four stars is the UPS man.  He kindly opened the door for me as I was leaving  I feel that they should make things right with the customer. This means going beyond offering the same service you failed to perform in the first place. Having lost faith that this location can perform a core competency and their questionable customer service  kind and going out of your way to help me with each visit. All businesses should take a page from your business model." la1oCfEWDvIG-9IzADLNdg "There are bad UPS stores and this is not one of them.  I've used this location frequently and while they are not always the most polite folks in the neighborhood  but found an affordable shipping rate for me without too much of a delivery delay.  Renn also gave me coupons for my next visit.  I was all smiles when I left."  seemingly reasonable pricing ($5 notarization)  there's a bunch of cars trying to get in here to park. I highly recommend avoiding that window of time if at all possible." "Eek... I went in to ship a package on Dec. 21st for Dec. 24th delivery. Yeah... I know... A bit last minute but still within the delivery windows. I took a 5.5 lb package to UPS and asked for a quote. The man working the counter told me it would $131 to ship to package and an additional $4.95 for packaging. I expressed surprise at the amount and he curtly added ""that must be the price of a one-way plane ticket."" Well... actually... that's pretty close. I said thank you and took my package to the Post Office The owner is almost always at the store and is very attentive.  He will help fill your shipping needs and engage in some light chatter.  just to be sure the item was secure. The owner was very confrontational during the entire exchange. I would have given him the benefit of the doubt and said maybe he was just having a bad day The owner started yelling and cursing.. what a terrible time.. everyone at the store was unbelievably uncomfortable and i can say i will never be back there Convenient location in Quail Hollow area and plenty of excellent customer service"  they have a $5 minimum on credit cards so they try to up sell you after all these other charges." "I drive over from Myers Park to ship my stuff here. They always help me get things out without a hassle. I am surprised to read the poor reviews  especially from the owner.  We ship infrequently but he still knows and greets us by name!  This is a small business in the age of big-box impersonality and we are glad to support them!"  I kindly let him know that I was there to pick up a package that UPS emailed me about. The email confirmed that the packed had arrived yesterday and was in this store waiting for pickup. After taking the time to explain this TWICE to the person at the counter  and even offered to ship the items on different days to make it easier for us. He even stayed open past closing time to accommodate us.   It's not cheap  but I wasn't really paying attention. I just wanted to drop off my pre-paid package and be on my way. The clerk was friendly and helpful and got it done pronto. If I have more UPS mailing requirements  but i tend to use this UPS store's services over competitors. it is full service and I've never had any issues here. The staff is super friendly and always helpful and it's never as crowded as the post offices on Park Road or South Blvd. I'm always in and out in 5 minutes. Definitely worthwhile to come here."  and it was taken care of extremely quickly! I barely had to wait in line and the package was even missing some tape uZLzfKD5VSAlthAkXLlARw A UPS store with no UPS envelopes. Still had to purchase an envelope to mail my UPS package. "Definitely a fan! It's great having a place around the corner that I can get all my work stuff done at. The best thing I like about this store is that the employees actually try to get to know you and help you with whatever you need. Whenever I come in "Stopped in with a large box to find out how much it would cost to ship it. The gal behind the counter was friendly  not terrible.  They ship stuff  owners go out of their way to help and are always friendly and fast.  they have even helped me figure out how to package something myself to save money.   truly looking out for customers best interest not just making a buck"  and polished product. I've gone to FedEx and other large scale printers and they pale in comparison to what this PostNet location is delivering."  etc to get it to work. I typically order my brochures through an online service for real estate and something went wrong (let's just leave it there). I randomly dropped into PostNet because my coworker always raves about them. I showed up with my laptop and a 35M pdf file. I left with my brochures in hand "The worst. They tried to have my car towed for parking in their ""delivery spot"" that was marked with a sign so small you'd need binoculars to see it. Not cool."  a suite number is not necessary because we have a front desk that handles deliveries. Then they mailed me a letter stating that I had to go to Middleton to pick it up or they would send it back to the store. I live no where near Middleton and refuse to pick it up. So hope and pray that you do not have to deal with this store."  I find out the package (which my receipt said was shipped as a ""first class package"") still hadn't arrived. I tried tracking the package on the UPS site and the tracking information was invalid. I called UPS and they could not use the tracking information and suggested I call the store. I did and as soon as I started to provide the tracking information "I went to pick up some signs I had printed for my small business in Middleton.  The woman there was so rude that I walked out and drove across town to Fedex.  I had been a customer at this UPS store for flyers and signs for the past few years and had never seen this woman there before... Nonetheless very unprofessional...just can't trust them." "i have never had bad service here... really not sure what the complaints are for?  They always tell me the most cost-effective rate They got it redelivered and the guy that delivered it was so nice I'm giving them 3 more stars for making up for everything." We use this store regularly for convenience sake only. The service is so hit or miss. They can be really nice and helpful. Or you can be treated like you're bothering them. If you can Don't bother unless you like shelling out a few extra bones."  but I like the idea of my stuff getting to where it's supposed to on time :-)   Chuck and his staff are great.  Highly recommend" "I've had to drop off a couple of boxes (on two different occasions) of textbooks to ship back to the rental place.  Both times I waltzed in and handed the boxes to the person behind the counter (well  sending packages and they help me with work projects. They are very accessible by phone   the owner is extremely off putting and on one occasion pointed his finger at me.   I find the prices very high and would avoid shopping here if you can." "Once you navigate the madness known as ""Central Ave. Construction"" and arrive at this Kinko's you are met with the most friendly and professional staff. It is worth the travel time for ya'll I promise. Other Kinko's i will be going to the washington one from now on."  the service is excellent it always gets there when they say it will. They are super quick when they help you and they will even package it up for you.  There are some really wonderful people working in the shipping dept. Chris being one of them. A truly nice person who really wants to help you as best as he can. If only more of us took pride in our job like that.  Great location  than fine. But I never associated FedEx with this kind of situation and I am very hesitant to go back or recommend this location to anyone. I could handle the sleeping but the IV needle on the desk was too much." Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again. I was in and out of that place in two minutes. :)" They have a lot  of parking.  They also take cash They are also a Kinkos copy center to make copies of stuff and purchase office supplies. If you need this stuff late night Always helpful and superior service! I say Run as fast as you can away from this center"  this FedEx is a 24 hour service location. Staff is helpful and friendly. We had to snail mail a letter and weren't sure about the options with FedEx. Staff took time to explain shipping options and prices."  cleanish facilities. All around an okay experience."  then cut my prints in half.  We all just got lucky that someone didn't need anything time intensive or else the whole process would have broken down."  was willing to go above and beyond to make sure that we received everything we needed in time. I really appreciated the offer I don't know about the rest of the staff but Beth gets 5stars!" FYI: They also have a small section of office supplies and I got the best stapler ever.  It powers through stacks with the ease of one finger touch."  and the staff did not help out with any shipping options."  horrible attitudes. I created a yelp account to write this review. Absolutely rude and incredibly expensive." "This FedEx Kinkos totally saved the day! Came here after the FedEx Kinkos on Camelback dropped the ball. Last minute directions to my Wedding; expertly done by John. Won't bother with any other location  very rude and not helpful at all. Acted as if looking for my email was a huge hassle. Come to find out only the color printer was down. It should be specified and the workers should know what's going on in the facility. $3.00 later I finally have my email printed with no help to the "" workers""" "Service here absolutely blows. I've only experienced good service by one gentleman. Otherwise  copier and day saver extraordinaire! My niece and I were getting copies for a memorial service  even mounting the photos on poster board for us. He blew the other girls out of the water and saved the day."  unless you're a big mouthed fat WASP who reeks of money. I was overlooked while I was in the process of faxing some documents because both employees at the counter assisted said WASP while he stood and assessed his his display. It was very disappointing."  it's as good as it gets."  ""well worst case scenario....yada yada yada"" because it's not the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is you over charge my card and put the wrong address in your mailing system. You then never refund my money and I never get my package delivered. That's worst case but even then it could get worse!" "Just went here to discuss getting some items printed. the people I talk to know nothing about printing and fed ex should stick to shipping.   they send every thing out "I went into kinkos the other day to have my baby shower invitations printed. When we walked in we were greeted right away by Trevor and he explained to me that he had a large printing project ahead of time and that mine wouldn't be ready until the next day. I wanted to see what they would look like before I completely committed to it but since the color printer was being used he was not able to do that for me. Instead he set me up at a self service printer. Well  INCLUDING THE KIOSKS. How are you supposed to be angry and annoyed with us when we would prefer to do the copies ourselves but can't because you can't put the time and/or effort to service your machines from time to time. Just absolutely frustrating. But I guess thanks for doing the copies even though it was accompanied with the rude attitude??"  and efficient.  He explained to us how to format our documents so that they would print clearly with the formatting we wanted.  He re-formatted the documents for us a few times and remained patient in the face of our hectic attitude and requests.  The documents were printed off within minutes and we were on our way.  We are so thankful that this branch of FedEx made printing so easy and we will definitely use them the next time we need to print anything." I am not usually compelled to write reviews but my experience this morning at this particular FedEx location was excellent! I had to print out 65 certificates and several other documents and we got it all done within 10 minutes because of the awesome help from the staff at the FedEx! I really appreciate how convenient it was and how easy it was working with the staff and even though I made a lot of decision changes last minute he seemed very patient and I really appreciated that. I'm definitely coming back! "Came in to quickly scan and email some documents.  Was greeted right away and taken to a workstation to get started.  I wish I got the name of the guy who helped me  i really never want to again. They are never very pleasant and don't seem happy about anything.           Plus UPS seems to always smash every package i send or receive.  They are in the same parking lot as AJ's and a few other bussiness.  I really do not know how they stay in Bussiness. Someone likes them Very friendly location with a nice touch of solid customer service.  Drop-offs are a cinch! These guys were extremely friendly and professional. I needed to ship my laptop for repair and the gentleman there measured and remeasured to be sure he was using the smallest box (giving me the best price). After it was all ready to go I remembered my debit card was cancelled a few days ago due to fraud...I profusely apologized and said I'd come back later with cash. The man helping me said he would pack it up for me and take my husband's card payment over the phone so I didn't have to make another trip. So nice. I've also used the store on 7th St. and McDowell and a store in Tucson and had similar experiences of above and beyond service and friendly staff. Couple this with below average FedEx service on a few occasions I won't use anyone else for shipping services. "This store is located next to AJs. I have used this place on a couple of occasions where UPS was required. Each time I have found the employees to be very friendly and polite and got me in and out quickly. The store is a little too cluttered but other than that  should I call him? This was a big refund I was asking for not a couple bucks I could just forget about. He told me to call him later that week. I called three times and went into the store once and he wasn't there any of the times and no one working there would help me. I finally went in yesterday and he was there. I was third in line and by the time I got to the front there were two more people behind me. He said I would need his ""undevoted"" attention and so he needed to help the other people really quickly since he was the only one there. Well he proceeded to help them as well as the other 5 people that walked in after them while I sat and waited. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes he gave me his ""undevoted"" attention which consisted of taking 30 seconds to give me a tracking number  from something I had previously shipped and then another 30 seconds to tell me that he had checked about the refund and was told no because the information was correct and the address is deliverable. OF COURSE THE ADDRESS WAS CORRECT! And since the address was correct and deliverable STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!! this place is an absolute joke. I came in today 10/29/2013 to have my I-9 notorized and let me tell you the asshole behind the counter is lucky I had my daughter with me. First off good job to John Willard Crawford for once again jackin shit up for all black people kudos asshole. Second he did not have to be completely rude to my wife if you know you job so well john then why didn't you do it and now I have to return to your God forsaken shit hole of a store with directions on how to do your job to fix it humm John why is that? I will tell you because you have no clue thats why and your arrogance is a hilarity at best and a travesty all around. Get your head out of your ass admit when your wrong or have not a clue and step down off you high horse. Oh and i payed in change cuz you were a dick sir a wothless flaced good for nothing but wasting my time dick. Oh and nice professionalism with the jersey and shorts good look for a man who is old enough to be my dad. Grow up do your job learn people skills and maybe you will get more stars so  to some it up SCREW THIS PLACE!!!!! This location is evil with an evil owner named John and a useless manager named Kimberley.  I would rather watch wallpaper dry tbs. have to deal with this store for anything!!!  This location needs to be shut down. NEXT TIME WE WILL USE FEDEX." 1U__JyhW9eiZ2z4djki1WA  but without fail the morning employee has never shown up before 8:10am on any morning I've been there. It's not uncommon for a decent sized group to gather outside the front doors waiting. When he does arrive he generally looks like slept in his clothes and smells very strongly of BO. The prices for any packing supplies are also extremely high here. In any case  the guy working there who barely speaks English didn't help much. Let me know my package was lost and I have to come back to see the owner at a time that is only convenient for him. Now I have to rearrange my schedule to suit the owner because "" he will not answer his phone on Saturday"" this is place is unprofessional as they come. Do yourself a favor and stay out of this dump." "They don't know what they're doing. I spent over 30 minutes waiting for them to figure out how to print a single sheet of paper. I understand if some employees are new or unfamiliar with technology "Poor customer service for the owner! I received a notification from FedEx notifying me of my delivery to my PO Box. I checked my PO Box and no package. I asked the owner about a package for my box # he said Previously have been solid on print work. Store hours 8a-6p. Have been waiting 29 minutes to pick up graduation certificates and store not open for their posted hours...lame!  the staff was very helpful in finding my confirmation info for returned AT&T U Verse equipment for which I am being billed as non-returned." "I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative There are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee." "I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad My advice is to avoid this store. If you need UPS services  UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said ""I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there"" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said ""I don't care either"" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them  distrustful and unreliable.  If you need to ship something important  and just looks at you when you come in with blank stare. I came in to return package that needed very small amount of tape and I asked her if I could use some tape and she said it would cost me extra $1.10 for small amount of tape for top of box. She said strict orders from owner. Wow so you would rather lose a customer instead of giving them small amount if tape to help them out. I now go out of my way to go to another ups store." Good luck John and Kimberly!!!" Unbelievably bad experience.  Not only is the woman behind the counter the rudest person I have ever met in my life she refused to answer a simple question. Anyone should be able to tell you what the estimated time frame for ground shipping us. Is it 12 days or 21 she had to be given an explanation of what I was asking.  I will be using FedEx to ship anything just yo not have to deal with her again. This place is the WORST. The older brunette woman behind the counter is not only incredibly rude but she an amazingly small amount of knowledge for all things shipping! I could grab any homeless person off their medication and place them behind the counter and their endless ramblings about the C.I.A. putting a chip in thier brain would make more sence then this older woman. This is the problem with the ups store no two are alike. This ups store is like a private sector version of the DMV! Steer clear! "I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class  is no longer employed at this location (or any other store).  The service is much improved." Great customer service just left there 2 minutes ago and had write the review due to efficacy and politeness of my attendant.  Great job!! "I had to ship a pair of shoes with a prepaid label. I came with just the shoes thinking I could just by the box and tape it up. (I brought my own packing tape) I explained that I needed a box and went to grab one and the lady behind the counter stated I could not pack my own box. She had to pack it and it would cost $16 or so. I left immediately and went to the Fedex store across the street at towne and country. I went in and bought a box for $2. They offered my tape FOR FREE and apologized for UPS and said the person working there was probably scamming people. Sounded like it to me too originally. So I packed my box and wanted to ship through Fedex   they always tape it up for me at no cost.   Not here.  They charge a $1 handling and taping fee for all prepaid packages.  I thought the guy was joking until he asked me if I had read the sign.  He pointed to a partially blocked sign  so Ms. Princess won't have to worry about having her playtime interrupted by me again. Buh-bye UPS Store #2780."  he rushed out to my car to carry it in for me. He was so helpful. My package made it on time and it cost much less than I expected. Thank you so much!" Best of luck to all other mailers out there!" Just had a bad experience here with the owner today (2/12/15).  Never go here!  He is very unprofessional and the owner called me an idiot.  The owner needs to learn some people skills instead of bullying customers around.  Would give zero stars if I could.  I've been to other UPS stores and never had any problems.  This was my first visit to this specific location.   Never again.  I did call the UPS store customer service 800 # to file a complaint and they were very understanding.  they look for opportunities to overcharge and call it customer service." "People at this store are always friendly and willing to help. I've gotten copies and dropped off packages to ship. Always in and out in a huff  about the size of a shoe box and the owner/clerk said there would be a $1.00 handling fee to tape the box. I said never mind and took it to another UPS store at Desert Ridge and they did not charge. A bunch of cheap asses at this location."   the service man Jose and another man were chatting away complaining bout people right in front of me. He took my package I'd give 0 stars if I could! This is the 2nd UPS location in Phoenix I've experienced just horrible customer service! I have used UPS for years and never experienced a problem. I will no longer be using UPS due to the terrible treatment I received here and at the Central and 3rd location. I mentioned the bad reviews and was told the person responsible for those awful reviews no longer works there. I hope this location can get their stars back up because they deserve more than 2 for sure!!"  the one that's not doing it right"". Instead of showing a little bit of customer service and trying to help me out he was making me feel like I was doing everything wrong and talking down o me. I even asked if he could be a little bit nicer and he just chuckled  completely unprofessional. Rude. How does UPS give this guy a franchise and let him represent them?? Fed Ex all the way from now on. The employees are dumb as rocks and the owner has no sense of customer service. Save yourself the headache and frustration "I've been here multiple times throughout the year including christmas time and I've never had to wait! I love that I am in and out & staff is always friendly. Only thing is that they charge to use their tape if you have a package that needs to be closed Enter at your own peril. The owner is extremely rude and yells at customers. He even became aggressive with us.  there was just a lot of copying and regular business stuff going on."  I wish he would have shown a different way to express his dissatisfaction with the job.  It would have been much cooler of him to get back at the man by hooking me up then my effing up my order." I use FexEx Kinko's locations as my on the road office a great deal and of all the Phoenix locations I prefer this on the most. Last time I checked this was a 24 hour facility so the hours listed are incorrect.  member since 06... you'd think you'd learn how this stuff works by now. Also Employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you.  they acted like I was an inconvenience to them.  The fax machine erred and I had to fight to have my price adjusted to the correct amount." I'm upping my review to four stars and will be back."  they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good." Shipping is expensive too."  wanted to custom make our wedding invites. I came up with a very unique concept and Eric made it doable. We made our layout and got our card stock from Kelly's paper and brought it in. The test run worked but when we tried to print a large amount the ink started smudging after the third one. The staff was nice enough to help us and told us we were using the wrong settings "It's open 24 hours! Printed some large posters and handouts for a presentation. Submitted the job online and it was done as requested. Best thing is that it's open 24 hours  I sincerely appreciate each and every one of you who had a hand it keeping me a happy girl!"  but the guy at the counter told me I could get a quality outdoor banner for almost the same price (It was on sale). So I gave them the file and let them know I needed it the next day. They called me later that day to let me know it was ready early which worked out great because I was able to pick it up after work without the birthday boy finding out! They always have some sort of special in the store or I see different offers pop up when I check in on Yelp. Great place for printing!" Go to UPS!! I came here because I had to turn in a assignment for school and my scanner wasn't working so I figured I could get them to scan a few papers and email them to me for a buck or two. They said they couldn't do that unlike a UPS store. My options were to either pay to use there over priced computers at like 70 cents a minute with a single page scanner or they could sell me a USB and put it on the overpriced 11$ USB.. From now on I will continue to give my business to UPS stores and plan better in the future so I don't end up having to use this late night crap store again  cut and make his fliers. It would have been nice for her to try and take care of me and get me out of the store with my one purchase then go back to her 30 min project." When you're in a jam and need to print 24/7 "Horrible! Wish I would have read the reviews first. Do not get anything you care about laminated it here. They did a terrible job and ruined my son's senior collage. I am more than upset. They didn't even apologize  i wasn't even complaining about waiting. she says to me i'll give you the copies for free that's when i said to her considering you're attitude? but i bet she never heard me say that since she kept talking over me. I asked if they sell envelops? she wouldn't even show me where they were she just pointed and said somewhere over there. I also asked if they sell stamps she said no i asked her if she had a problem with me? She said no im just telling you we don't sell stamps  which is 3 miles away and less convenient. The employees were just standing around and place had 1 other customer. Recommend any other place. The one in Town and Country on Camelback and 20th St is great."  fax stuff and the list goes on and on...."  the lady who was working was obviously closing up but let me drop it off anyways- super nice! Come the next day I realized I was supposed to drop it off at fed ex and not UPS. I went to the fed ex website to try to track it & thankfully it was off for delivery. This UPS store was kind and thoughtful enough to make sure my package was sent with the right people. They totally did not have to do that and it was so sweet of them. I will definitely be going to them for future package/shipping needs. A million plus for customer service."  and I have never had a bad experience.  They are especially good at logging packages into their system right away so you can receive an e-mail delivery notice asap.  The only tough thing about the location is the parking.  Because it's close to Pita Jungle and Wildflower This location is terrible. Save yourself a headache and go a mile down the road to the UPS store on 44th and Oak. I bought a box to ship my laptop in and they said I had to go put it together in the parking lot even though I bought it and was shipping it at their store.  the owner personally picked them up from our place and took them to their UPS Store on 44th street and Indian School Road. My aunt could not be more happy and relieved. Very personable and professional service." I love the UPS store this location is no exception. Every employee is so friendly! Not to mention the service is lightning fast. I wish every shipping experience could be as easy and friendly as it is with UPS and it's staff.  when you fill out all the pertinent info right there in the store. Pretty convenient It just doesn't get any better. They are batting !00 %. I have an antique clock business. They have packed all my clocks that I sell and all my clients are blown away with the packing. Not one clock has arrived with any issue. They are very friendly and reasonably priced. Thanks  it's no surprise that Bridget has been positively mentioned before!  She's friendly "Great customer service here!  I have an account and they are fantastic about providing support  took the time to listen to my nervous details and quickly turned around a beautiful product for my small business. Shout out to Jessy - she was a pleasure to work with and personally followed up with me by phone! This UPS Store truly understands the importance of customer service. Thanks guys!" Bonus x 2 - this UPS store carries some cute greeting cards in addition to all of your shipping needs!"  I usually go to the one on Hayden it's smooth and easy I got asked a ton of questions like I work at UPS and understand all the ins and outs just want to ship something. I let him know whatever was easiest and now I'm writing out all this info which is fine but I don't have to do this at the other location so I don't say anything and fill everything out which I've shipped to these locations before so even I know they keep them in the system and he says to me ""don't be so lazy"" I just laughed but that is ridiculous to say to someone. I will stick to Hayden location considering I ship things every week for our business"  complete with eye rolls and everything. It started because she asked me a question and it took me a sec to realize she was talking to me because I was in the middle of saying something to my daughter. Either she was just having a bad day or she totally hates her job. Either way  they act and operate like they WANT my business and appreciate it. That's why I keep coming back I have gone to this UPS store for years.  The staff are all very friendly and efficient.  One time I was in and a very senior woman was sending a package.  The man helping her was patient and courteous and treated her with utmost respect.  It was nice to see him treat an older person with such dignity.  They are very good to their customers and if you want a smiling welcome when you walk through the door you won't be disappointed.  it is not more than $1.50 anywhere else). I just don't like that nitpicking and trying to make money on stupid petty stuff. I was making extra effort and going off my way to come and do my business here I've loved doing business with this UPS store for many years now. You get the feeling that there will be no problems with your packages when shipped. The owners are on site 99% of the time and they make it quick and easy to ship or do any other service. Sometimes I walk in with things half done and they act like it's no big deal and finish it up for me. They don't even charge for their tape like another local UPS store does. Anyway always courteous and professional in the services they provide. I've been using this mailbox service for years and am incredibly happy with the service. The owner and employees are extremely helpful and friendly. They always greet me by name and with a smile. I'm always in and out of there quickly and would highly recommend this over a p.o.box. It is pricier but well worth it. I've had mailbox services at other ups locations and was not as happy with the service.  This location the best!  which is a shame since they are so close to my house."  I am greeted with a smile and the employees are super enthusiastic about helping me with my shipping needs. Having such a wonderful alternative to the post office in a convenient location is so great!"  courteous and efficient.  If you're in the neighborhood  $20 for two F@#$%&! FAXES!?!? OUTRAGEOUS RIP OFF. I feel wholly taken advantage of and I'm pissed off. Nobody bothered to warn me of pricing before sending anything. That is an ABSURD price. "We have been using this store for over 5 years. They are great at service. Vic is always an engaging and fun to talk with. He takes the pain out of spending money to ship things. I look forward to visiting the store "We've had our biz address at this location for a year now. Their service is great and the staff is friendly. They also always carry out the large packages that we often receive The hours say that this store opens at 7:30. It is now 8 o'clock and still the gates are all locked up and lights are off. I called their phone number and I got an answering machine. They should change their posted hours or make sure they have employees that come in on time. "Very friendly and helpful people. I needed to return several things I ordered online from different retailers. The people at The UPS Store were happy to help me organize all my packages I can't say enough good things about this UPS Store. They are always very friendly and helpful when I come in. I do a lot of online shopping and they gladly ship my returns out. They do not charge me for tape and always give me a receipt. Recently I was running late and I stopped in the store 1 minute before they closed. They were still very happy to assist me and my transaction was fast and smooth. Will always use them for my future shipping needs. I am happy to give my business to this location." Great guys very helpful and obviously have a local group of regulars. I've done a fair amount of business with these guys and wi continue to do so. Normally I love this store Dong takes real good care of me all the time but this guy Justin was a total jerk I will only ask for Dong in the future!  and I was out of there in under a minute.  My experiences here are typically like this. They are very customer oriented I will definitely give them my business again!  Service was above and beyond while shipping items for my daughter's school. Great service - thanks! another to ship a $130 headset (which was THROWN into my gated yard and nearly damaged upon receiving via FedEx that i'm not counting in this review) and another to fax an important document. when i went here to print via the computers available for public use via a reloadable store card the employee who loaded the card and got me started made me feel like i was stupid for not knowing how to insert the card and get their old windows 2000 fired up for use and printing! the overall staff and service quality is OK  and it's a nice sized store that never has a long wait to use anything. They also offer free wifi to customers. I just found out today that they take credit and debit cards and you don't have to prepay their card. How convenient! I like having that choice."  you can't search FedEx locations from a FedEx????  We asked about Saturday delivery and she had no idea how that worked or what would happen to the package if it couldn't be delivered on Friday.  She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75 My experience here was easy breezy. I had to send a fed ex envelope and the representative was able to help me immediately. He gave me my receipt and showed me my tracking number and I was all set. I'd say I was in and out of there in 5 minutes.  FedEx just LOST all my business!! (I am a power seller on ebay and usually take my stuff in direct)" I just started coming to this location and an really happy with the service here!! they are open EARLY and always ready to help me! "Excellent staff that is always friendly. It's a quick and convent location. Even during the busy holiday season I recently bought a few templates off Etsy that I wanted to print for my upcoming wedding. This store made it so easy! I emailed the documents and in less than 24 hours I had my rehearsal dinner invites printed and cut. The price was great. Had I realized how easy the process was I probably would have gone the diy for wedding invites. The store is well staffed and employees are friendly. Best UPS I've been to! Friendly and knowledgeable people. We went there for fingerprinting for our CCWC permits and they did what Fedex couldn't. They did two sets for me and my wife for $20 per person in less than 15 minutes. They even have us a freebie for being nice to them. Highly recommend this pace for your shipping needs I'm telling you - Kinko's knows what you need before you do."  and the staff is always friendly (even at 2 in the morning).  I've been extremely pleased with the quality of print services I've received.  This place is great if you procrastinate on a school or work project and need something printed up real spiffy-like in a hurry."  1 star because for being a print center they should be able to PRINT."  and helping a sister out.  I don't know what I would have done of they weren't open so early and so readily available to help." I had some items I needed copied for first week of school that were not something I felt I could do on my own because of irregular sizing etc. I went full service and it was quick and painless and I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Awesome that this location is open on Sundays. I'm here every day Monday through Friday. Dropping FedEx packages off for my company. Three employees are friendly professional and courteous. All the rest basically ignore me or if I have issues take forever to help me. The amount of time you have to wait to check packages in is unbelievable.  I had asked and hung up on me before I could even finish my sentence. I would say that's pretty terrible service" "Refused to deliver to military address even though corporate office and fedex.com state that FedEx does deliver to apo "Sad...  We went there to make some copies of some documents and we realized while we were there that we forgot to sign one line.  We needed a blue pen to sign it  another customer was being told hes too late for the last pick up because the fed ex truck was already there. so my worker and the other worker starting going at it about the other customer. I interrupted and told the customer the late pick up at the other fed ex on Scottsdale road. the worker helping me snapped that they had their pick up already and said I was wrong. well I am not wrong because I ship there when I am running late for this centers early pick up. so anyways I went to another FEDEX location very close by and the wonderful man behind the counter never even hesitated and took my FEDEX SHIPMENT." "The postage and shipping rates here are high compared to other places. I don't know what it is but every time I come here to ship something or buy postage I expect to spend way more than what I would normally spend at other places. Their reasoning is because they charge more than what the post office charges for convenience "This store definitely gets a lot of traffic especially with the notaries and the custom print jobs that they do. They're great at giving me a selection between the Postal Service and ups pricing and a variety of different delivery dates  but before it was bc it was close to my house. Moving forward it will be because I know the service there is great and I'll be sure to tell my friends and family about it. Thank you for your service Amber! I appreciate you!"  these people were so kind and easy to work with. So glad to find a place where shipping is easy!" I agree with the first review. The people who work here are exceedingly friendly and I have had less than positive experiences and other UPS stores in the valley. I've also had my business PO Box here for years and their rates have never gone up.  2 were very damaged! They packed them with saran wrap and placed all in a big box with popcorn. For the amount they charged for packing (almost $40)  and rude customer service! I waited for 15 mins just to drop off an already paid for box and there was only one other person ahead of me? The lady at the counter clearly doesn't understand the concepts of lines. Another customer causal walked in back to pick up her mail then cuts in line to retrieve a package. The lady at the counter glanced at me then helped that customer first? After they were done chit chatting she THEN helped me?! Also I don't think the AC was working properly in that store. It was hot and smelled bad
