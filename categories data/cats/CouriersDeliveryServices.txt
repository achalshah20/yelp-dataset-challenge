I am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy's service." "This awesome pharmacy is a throw back to the good ol days before the big box shops took over with their huge outlets and lack of personal service. I love CVP! They remember your name Have been using CVP since it opened in the 1970's. The service is fantastic and the people are outstanding. Since I moved to North Scottsdale it is not as convenient but I still would not use another Pharmacy!  I found Camelback Compounding Pharmacy in my own backyard! Wonderful and so helpful even on a Saturday!"  you can opt for the 4 hour service and save some coin. They offer 2hr The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the contracted driver Michael was accommodating and waited for me. It was an easy delivery  they stated on the court paper that they did serve the paper to my ex and even said they talked to her  DO NOT use this company.  The person tasked with scheduling my delivery notoriously did not call me back.  It took me 5 calls to get a hold of him.  Then after I received an email confirmation with the wrong date of delivery than what was scheduled "I wish I had read these reviews before I bought from Wayfair. We had a similar experience. They're supposed to call before they come. Instead they delivered three large bookshelves which were already assembled. They came at 6:45 am and they blocked both of our cars. The call came at 7:10 am. When my husband said I thought you were going to call before I have been using Hot Shot for almost four years now. Lisa is probably the best customer service rep of any company I have ever used. Period. John is a hands on owner who cares about the customers that use his company. Katrina is available 24/7 for any needs that arise including last minute deliveries. I would highly recommend them!!
