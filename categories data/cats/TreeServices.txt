 ground up the stump and cleaned up the area!  We are very impressed with the high quality of the work. It was top notch. We will definitely hire this company again and give them best recommendations.  Thank you  but when you have a tree hanging over your new porch that's half dead and have birds sitting on it pooping on you while you're trying to enjoy your deck wine I'll gladly recommend these guys to anybody!"
