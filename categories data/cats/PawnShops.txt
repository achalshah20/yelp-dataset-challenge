So this kid named Brendan I think that was his name anyway he treated me extremely rude and like a common criminal....... being that he was wearing two obscene diamond earrings and wearing a gun on his hip he was obviously compensating for the little man's disease so I should empathetic but whatever he's a complete ass....... He's not Noah that's for sure ( his predecessor I assume)....... As I've said before about other places your money is better spent elsewhere Til next time I really enjoy this signage. On an almost daily basis. Savy I cannot believe they could not conduct a transaction at 7:03 after I had called them twice and let them know exactly where I was." Go see Kat and the team at Super Pawn on Central!!" Young man behind the counter was very helpful and went out if his way to answer every question I had. Think his name jessy. $4 strings are the sheeeit! Best place to buy guitars and pedals... Great workers there.  Super mega awesome customer service.  I wouldn't get my instruments from anyone else. Customer service is HORRIBLE here. 3 grown men all standing behind the counter chatting and looking at me while im trying to get my mini fridge out of the car...I had to go inside and ask for help... There's certain things that you should just know to do when working retail. This was unacceptable. I won't be returning.  gave me a runaround when i was trying to return it. Very rude and unhelpful staff" mdMFNJ-i_td1QMmhdhAmgw  very helpful and friendly. Best prices in the valley and get the most for your goods. Best rates hands down.."
