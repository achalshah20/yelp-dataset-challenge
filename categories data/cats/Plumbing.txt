Will definitely return when we have a master bath or kitchen remodel.  These two we won't be doing ourselves.  We'd like to save our marriage." I have ordered and received very special high end Baldwin Hardware and bathroom hardware and the service is amazing. Ask for Michael "I just completed a 7 month project remodeling a 95 year old home on the central coriddor. Michael at Clyde Hardware was my sole source for Baldwin locks for my home inside and out. They have the greatest selection  I was told that there were tons of choices. I found the perfect pulls. They also have the most unique bath tubs  plus made several trips to the store and to be treated like that??  No wonder amazon and other competitors are cleaning their clocks and they have a sign on their door not allowing photos." "The showroom at this place is amazing...too bad the staff doesn't match. I have never been treated so bad. Associate after associate was rude to me...independently!!!! I asked for a specific part politely and with a smile. I greeted them and was snubbed. They didn't have the part and Great selection.  Very helpful. Everyone was friendly gave my dog cookies & water. Good pricing!  left a little early so I'd make it before 4 and they had the exact part I needed. They probably could have ripped me off (I was desperate) but I got out of there for 54 cents (tax included). The people there were friendly and helpful." I was pleasantly surprised by how nice and helpful they were. I had a difficult problem and they help me solve it over several days and several visits. Thank you again!
