We are new to the area but really enjoyed our first season w Strikers.  Super nice office staff & they really seem to love the game & encourage the kids to Have fun & enjoy the game.  The format is slightly different...more like an indoor set up w the walls but it makes for a faster always moving game & helps to improve skills at a faster pace. "I can't tell you how many parents iv spoken to that were horrified at the methodology this organization uses to ""teach"" children soccer. They teach violence aggression competitiveness shame and all the things you don't want your child to take away from an activity you enroll them in so they be introduced to a world-recognized sport they can enjoy for life."
