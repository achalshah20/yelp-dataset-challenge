ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs."  the staff is extremely knowledgable and helpful.  There's none of the pushy sales tactics that you find at some of the other chain stores. They're honest and will make sure you get the mattress that's best for you and not their profit. The prices cannot be beat  nothing. I sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me. I had to do all the calling and got shoved around from person to person without a straight answer as to where my bed was. We had to get our old bed back from the people we gave it to so we didn't have to sleep on the floor. It was horrible. Then  do not expect any customer service after your purchase either." I especially love that they give back to local foster kids by collecting clothes at the store and are active in the local community." "Great experience! The staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful. I would tell any of my friends to go here. Quick in and out  and were promised a delivery date and window which were followed through on. Several days before our scheduled delivery we went back looking for a second couch and sideboard. The salesman was so helpful -  we told him our price range and what we were looking for and he got it right on the first shot And if you're even 1 day late they slap you with a 39.99 late fee and then you get to argue about it with someone obviously on a different continent.  It's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer.  They're in the business of making money off of late fees which is never a way to make customers happy."  he took our email address ""just in case there are any changes to the pickup date"" - but of course the next day we get advertisements to the email address which was only going to be used to alert us to pickup issues. Bait and switch and charging for things behind your back.  Just be careful and you can get out with your wallet and email intact!" bqmWxho70VwNyl9yudP4Gw I plan to make Rooms to Go my place to go for any other furniture we may need. We will be in the market for a sofa or chairs coming up and this is definitely where we will begin our search."  go across the street to Ashley....... to follow up 10 30.... got a call from a regional manager apologizing for the way I was treated. After MANY phone calls they did the right thing and honored the price I paid for the sofa. I did get an apology and that did help Shouldn't even get a star b c this company is horrible b c the customer service on the phone when I was trying to pay my bill was very rude b c I was about 45mins late from the cutoff time and they charged me a late fee. I will never shop here again. Ashley furniture will get my business from now on.  the two individuals delivering the furniture were very unprofessional and cursed when we informed them of this. At first they said they are unable to do so. We contacted the customer service line and they said that the delivery service is subcontracted and they couldn't do anything. We then contacted the delivery service and they stated that they would dissemble the bedframe but would not put it back together. They then stated they need to speak with the delivery men who proceeded to make a scene in our front yard about it.  Again  and they purchased the extra warranty after being told it covered 100% of  product issues.  The quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor. The store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the.  The store said they were sorry the furniture  warped and the covering was peeling "The worst customer service ever! I went in for a re-selection (exchange) within 24hrs of my purchase and I was treated in the worst manner possible. They already had my money "Absolutely horrible.....I purchased a carriage bed for my daughter. She was super excited and counting down the days until arrival.  They delivered the bed without screws! Then they basically said they could do nothing for 2-3 days.  My daughter will be devastated.  I know some people may say what's a few days but tell that to a 5 year old that just saw her brother get his bed delivered. What kind of company is this? They have completely horrible So sorry to see such a wonderful company in years past ll be ok but I hope that at least one person that reads this post goes else where it is worth it. Business is only as good as your word and RTG word is useless. After buying $20000.00 worth of furniture from RTG I will never step foot in the store again. The pineville manager promised he would look into it and call me the following day. That never happened. Buy with confidence and not RTG" "It was hard to get any help and when you eventually get help they end up trying to sell you things you don't need and manipulate you to thinking you need all this extra stuff. For example all we wanted was a couch. We were told it would have been cheaper to get the set with the two tables and a lamp! Thinking back and forth on it didn't seem right. We finally read the fine line back to the sales rep and told her we didn't need to get all the extra stuff and it was apparently cheaper. Her response was ""oh I didn't know sorry"".  We eventually got what we wanted but we it seem like we had to fight our way to really get what we wanted. I felt like we were at a car dealer ship the whole time we were there! Reading the other reviews I'm hoping I get my order on time with everything in tact!" "So I've bought furniture from them before and usually it's a good experience. **BUYER BEWARE** of items sold off of the floor.  I should have stayed to look at a rug we bought off of the floor before he folded it up but Ray our sales associate was really pushy to get us to grab the car. Needless to say he was a nice salesman but he knew that the color would be off where the furniture had been sitting on it and where all the traffic from buyers would be stepping on it. Usually when it's too good to be true it is! Orig. $399 and got it for $160.....but we'll see if we can steam clean it and get some of the stain out. So don't give RAY (Asian guy) your business.....we bought a $2500 sofa set as well and he could have at least tried not to dupe us into getting the measley few dollars more commission and told us the rug wasn't worth it. Cmon man....honest living...be good to your buyers that's how you get repeat business. Instead now I have to put you on blast for being dirty! Please take into acct what others have said. The customer service was great for the most part but when you spend $2500 and you can't even tell the buyer that a $160 rug off of the floor isn't worth it I WAS CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL PURCHASES AT A LATER DATE.  BUT FORGET THIS  piece of crap and the service is appalling .Don't fall for their gift card deals like we did."  and most of it is the same no matter where it comes from.  I like the style of the furniture I bought -- it's perfect for my boys I had read so many negative reviews but was desperate to get some new and affordable furniture.  The salesman that helped us was so nice and did not put any pressure on us.  The delivery driver called 30 minutes prior to delivery and showed up promptly with our furniture.  They were polite and courteous and moved the furniture in in no time at all.  It was wrapped in pads and blankets to protect it.  30 minutes after delivery someone from the store called to see how delivery went.  I could not be more pleased with the process.  Highly recommend! "This is by far the absolute worst furniture experience I have encountered.  We visited the store on a Saturday and of course were met at the door by the hungry wolves (sales).  We informed the lady we were just looking and continued walking.  The sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes.  After about an hour of looking  you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks." Bought a mattress & box spring from there and the salesman Proctor Freeman was very helpful. He asked us what we needed and we told him and what our price range was. We bought the mattress. Delivery guys called 30mins before delivery and they were really professional in their taking away our old mattress and replacing it with the new one. They even left us mints for us. I highly recommend this place.  but delivery person called at 9:45 pm to say he would not make it. I called and the store agreed to waive the delivery charge Matthew and Jackie took great of us. We needed a mattress on short notice and were on a tight budget. They both worked hard to fill our needs. I would not hesitate coming back for my next mattress purchase.  and super tolerant of my rambunctious 4 year old.  I highly recommend checking them out."  frame and headboard from Elliott!! We looked at the original mattress company and rooms to go but the knowledge and selection didn't compare to mattress firm. Elliott was very knowledgable and helpful Great in store. Poor follow up. Delivery issues. Still working out delivery for our headboard which was bought over a week ago. Coop was great.  Everyone was super helpful.  Was able to work a great deal.  I paid at 1130 am.  Mattresses were delivered by 3 pm.  Very happy with the service all around.  No complaints at all. "The guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending. Tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there. Anytime I answered a question he would respond in a manner that was almost as if he was mocking me. I get it - it's a sales tactic but if you like to be able to take your time on making a major purchase  sales reps were helpful.  Cancelling off an extra piece before delivery was easy and refunded quickly.  Recommend"  don't trust their delivery window ... 3-5pm?!? Try 6:30. And would have been nice if you called to let me know."  five stars - highly recommended!"  the top was badly damaged and we sent it back. Havertys kept us updated on when the replacement was being delivered (within a few days). New one arrived in perfect condition. After that IN802r0RXjETAuQh6jS4JQ We purchased a couple of items and expected the wait to be quite long since they were backordered. Yet they came much sooner. We were delighted until we saw that they were unlike the pieces on the showroom floor. We were so disheartened. But Christina was very kind IN802r0RXjETAuQh6jS4JQ When you walk into Havertys a sales person greets you and then follows you around - EVERY WHERE YOU GO.  Creeps me out. Wonder if they think I'm going stuff one of the chairs down my pants and run out. CREEPY!!!  knowledgeable and helpful sales folks who negotiated good pricing and delivery folks were good as well.  I cannot imagine a better place to buy appliances in the Charlotte area."  and it's nice when the quality of service is as good as or better than the big chains. Queen City didn't disappoint!" We'd recommend them over the national big box stores I highly recommend Queen City if you want a knowledgeable sales team that goes the extra mile "They don't stand behind the products they sell. $3  but because of the nature of the place nothing is guaranteed to be there." Discovered this place td. I think it's one to pop in while in the area to see if you're lucky. Parking is abundant but that doesn't mean they don't hv a lot.  so I suggest it to get an idea of what you like."  and accent pieces are very good.  Sometimes you can find pieces crafted with dovetail craftmanship!  I usually end of selling or giving the rug away b c they last forever if you keep a good routine (clean once every three months and vacuum every week).  I bought a couch and loveseat from here also and I don't like it at all.  So before you decided to buy a sofa set from here first check and make sure that it' built strong.  One person falls down too hard and the wood underneath cracks splits breaks.  Also WORST PLACE EVER!!! DON'T go!!!  Very rude.  The return policy is horrible!!!  Next day delivery means sit home ALL day from 7am-10pm. for broken furniture to be delivered. Stay away from sales person Kevin.   Ask to see the terms and conditions!!!  Before signing anything!!! vKHZVUwW1ewZju0PgeBbmg Staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. The company never responded to my questions in the store or online. Was willing to purchase high priced items with cash and couldn't get any help.  Worse experience ever. Worst delivery experience ever.  Driver used my bathroom and left the seat up.  He put the furniture together on my front lawn and refused to take my old mattress.  Told me that customer service wouldn't be open till 10 (delivery was at 7am) and when I refused to sign he just left.  I called customer service and they were zero help.  ""Let me go and get him for you."" She made it clear that she wasn't in the mood to help me or the other customer who was also seeking help. Anthony ended up helping us both."  but this will be my final purchase from them. EVER. I would rather pay double for something and deal with a business that gives a damn about their customers and doing the right thing than to give Rooms to Go another penny of my money."  but I the quality isn't the greatest. The selling factor for this furniture store is the price. If you're looking for something to own for about 3-5 years or are on a budget this might be your prefect fit. Also they seem to love leather sectionals here so if that's your thing this might be a good starting point in your search." This store has the worst and I mean worst customer service I have ever experienced!  Ordered furniture and paid for it in full.  Come to find out 5 days later they don't have it and won't have it for 4 months!  I tried to cancel the order and they said they can try to cancel it but it will take a while!!!  Really?  Very quick to take my money...but do not want to give it back in a timely manner.  Still no refund after 3 days....still waiting.  Do not do business with this company.  I am in process of disputing the charge now with my credit card company. Having said that...  Buyer beware."  we were to the point of being upset. We get home and we noticed the coffee table was opened and repackaged. When we open it  uncomfortable and just sad. I also never received the proper cushions for it. Do not buy this couch!! Total waste of 2500$!" Hopefully I'll be back for a dining room table ($399)  not too pushy. Higher quality most of the time over what you will find at particle board shops like Ikea The only downside to shopping there is their strict no refund/no exchange policy.  They will not budge under any circumstances.  I just got burned on that a few weeks ago on a new sofa and chair.  Rubin's Clearance Center is fine for smaller purchases.  For more expensive items  Rubin's Clearance was the first place we stopped. We found a great quality all wood bed at a great price and a Rubin's mattress and we love it. The salesperson was not pushy and very helpful. In fact  so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K  long way. I would recommend this place to anyone. Definitely made a hard day easier for us. I really saw no reason to keep shopping. I expect that I'll upgrade to five stars when delivery happens if it goes just as well  they know their stuff and will steer you right on what you need helping you to make your choice easy."  then their reasonable prices and product knowledge should seal the deal. Two thumbs up. I will be going back for sure."  all really good quality and extremely cheap. Very painless shopping and very good stuff. Delivery was also fine and inexpensive." Once again we needed furniture and Quality Furniture was the first place we thought to go.  Danny and Joey are always so helpful and easy to work with! We will continue to make Quality Furniture our #1furniture store! I highly recommend them and will definitely buy my next mattress from them."  as they are owned and operated by the same man.                                                                                               SCAMMERS if you chose What a great experience!  Thumbs waaaaay up!" This shop is full with charlatans that will do and say anything to sell you a bed!!! Don't make the same mistakes we made thinking this was a serious company .... IS A TRAP!!!!" I will never buy another Sleep Number Bed and would not recommend anyone else go through this headache." If you are thinking of getting a new mattress and are ""OLD SCHOOL"" like myself you really should try this place! If I didnt love my mattress soooo much and wasn't stuck in the 80's I would have walked with a new mattrress today...who knows .. maybe tomorrow!! Just letting my yelper friends know this product rocks and so do the employees here! Tell them Deb sent you...okay "Copenhagen rocks. I had the pleasure of stopping by the store about a dozen or so times over the past few weeks to redo my entryway and living room  and they still sell the Newton model there today.  I was wanting something a bit different that they didn't have in stock.  I priced it at the Denmarket and then checked online.  I had spoken with the manager Mary at the time of my pricing.  I looked online and found it cheaper through an online competitor.  Due to the economy I figured I would give Copenhagen the opportunity to compete.  I mentioned the price the competitor was giving and the free shipping and Mary had given me 10% off with free shipping to match the competitor.  She told me it would take about 4-6 weeks for my special order that I wanted and it was just a couple days over.  The furniture delivery occurred today  they custom ordered our couches from Italy (we picked the heavier material and the color)..." We will shop here first for all of our home furnishings!"  central Phoenix to north Scottsdale and even online then finally we found a wonderful collection of comfy great made furniture.  We had specifics and yes our taste comes into play which is why I was hesitant about going to Copenhagen. I really had in mind that Copenhagen was going to be overly priced and way too modern for my taste.  I was wrong.  It definitely is modern but they offer pieces that have a great balance with modern and semi traditional.  Their leather choices are fantastic from color to grade.  On top of that  and the overall company that people of color's money is just as good as Caucasian's. Perhaps this store would benefit from ""Sensitivity & Diversity"" training.  It is so rude to not welcome EVERYONE to your store The Camelback Copenhagen store is the only one I can recommend. The ones in Tempe and Scottsdale were extremely disappointing. The sales people at those stores ignored me the entire time and were too busy chatting among themselves. At least in the Camelback store the sales people offered assistance and were willing to explain some of the design features of the furniture. I will definitely shop again at the Camelback store.  but this experience has not only ruined my family plans for Thanksgiving but has me searching again for a new table and chairs. The lack of any contact from Copenhagen has been most frustrating "I think half our furniture in our house is from Copenhagen. Great style innovative designs and very contemporary. Always adds as a center piece on each room. The one set back is the quality of materials have seem to have declined over the years. Majority use to be solid wood I didn't feel pressured at any point and everyone was very polite.  While I didn't buy anything today there is a strong chance I'll be going back here often in the future."  this one of the few places in AZ that you can get it." "I love this store. It's always a fun treat when I find myself with the time to stop in. The sales staff are super friendly and not at all pushy. They have a wide selection of quality Get on their mailing list for their annual (or semi-annual) warehouse sale. I've found some good stuff there with slight wear or needing just minor reconditioning." Don't judge a book by its cover  I sprang from the bed as if I'd heard some clatter and got outta bed to see what was the matter. We settled on a less expensive version and have been peacefully sleeping ever since. Well. Except for my freight train snoring apparently. But I'll yelp about that later. The salesperson was a good sport as The Culinary Comedian and his fashion designer boyfriend were cracking up and cracking jokes as we lay  while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them  which was necessary for me since I fractured my back a few months ago and was having a hard time finding something that worked well with my back issues.  Thx Sleep America!"  you get what you paid for..my bad!! About 9 months ago I was back at Sleep America....thinking it was my mistake the last time...this time I spent almost 900.00 for a queen set for my teenage son. Every morning I have noticed a really funny sound when he is getting out of bed  2011. It has become very uncomfortable to sleep on it and the concern to make it right is non-existent at this point. They have received a report from Integrated Bedding Group but so far have failed to acknowledge that report. One of their reps told me that just because it was uncomfortable didn't mean it was defective. They tell you to shop local so you would think they would care about satisfying a customer. Never again will I shop there!" "My husband and I walked into the 19th Ave Christown Mall location with no idea what we wanted in a mattress.  All we knew was we had to get off of the one we were on.  Our salesman Marc (Uncle Marc) was fabulous.  Not only was he super friendly and quite knowledgable of their products but he went way above and beyond the call of duty for us.  We are now sleeping so soundly and we absolutely love our squishy pillows!  If anyone in the Phoenix area is in search of a new mattress  very rude sales person who must assume they are the only mattress provider in Phoenix. Needless to say we walked out from what could have been an easy sale and I rather go spend my money elsewhere." We went back to Sleep America where we bought our bed from Lonnie  I checked out a few other places on my quest for a new mattress before ending up at Bedmart. Should've just come here first. They've got a wide selection (a few actual beds Mattress purchasing is so insanely subjective that I wouldn't dissuade you from shopping at Bedmart; I'm sure someone else could find a bed they love and use for years there.  My own experience is that I wasted $800 with no recourse." No tossing and turning tonight !" Worst customer service experience ever!! I was looking for a mattress for my son and i told the guy I was just looking and he threw a fit and yelled at the other employee that i wasn't serious about buying a mattress and stormed away. I will never go back or suggest anyone to spend money in there  they were actually quite rude. They refused to take the bed back. I didn't even have it for 24 hours. If you see a good review on here it's probably from one of their employees. Just to let you know." We went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it I would not recomend this shop." Bedmart is a sleazy company.   Dishonest...   Pricing is horrible.   They try to rip you off...then start dropping the price when you show them that they are as twice as expensive as Ashley Furniture and Mega Furniture!!!!  For the exact same Simmons sleep set!!!!   Keep 1 hand on your money if you deal with this sleazy company. "I agree with the 0 star rating. Ordered box spring for Cal King and received Regular king box spring instead.  It's their mistake but would not admit and charging another delivery fee to come pick them up. It is insane! Nothing is written as return policy.  I thought about exchanging but now  I told the salesman that I wanted a price on a specific I Comfort mattress. I gave him the model name and size I wanted and was told they did not have that mattress in stock yet. I was then passed off to the manager who went to their computer and told me he found the mattress and it would be $1799.00 and that they had the exact same the mattress QfsO7GHhBlgOOYwDEVumkg Best thing is trying the mattress. I layed next to my little boy while he played games on my phone. I wanted to make sure no numb spots after laying for 10 minutes. They were super helpful!"  Jacob credited the sale to him. Every company should have a Jacob on their sales team. Thank you!" 55YiPBDdFKKqav0skwIUMQ  the buying experience was good.  The expectation and subsequent disappoint on the old mattress removal was a bummer but all-in-all  I heard him helping other people and he treated them so well that I waited for him. He really helped me compare so I could get the right bed for my guest room. I highly recommend this store and the salesman named Bob." I had an amazing time in mattress firm i spoke with gabrielle and told her that i moved here july of last year and how i have been sleeping on an air mattress every since but mattress now has a hole in it and ive been sleeping on the floor which isn't good because i have a  back and tailbone injury and she worked very hard with me bed after bed until i found one i really liked and could afford im happy that she was really trying to make me happy and comfortable instead of trying to get over on my i highly recommend this mattress firm. 55YiPBDdFKKqav0skwIUMQ "Gabrielle was horrible.  Sat at her desk in the back most of the time a ""new employee"" was financing a mattress for me.  Was told a price and the employee asked her I front of me and she told her divide it by 26 and that is going to be the payment. Get the paperwork and the payment is double of what I was told.  Called and Gabrielle is denying that she told the poor employee to divide by 26. Now I'm going to be stuck with a payment that I can't afford because the ""manager"" told a employee to do something that was obviously not the thing it was.  Gabrielle sat at her desk in the back like she was the all mighty while the employee was trying her best to help out.  Which ended up screwing me. I'm supposed to get a call from her supervisor(her being Gabrielle). Let's see if it happens.  Gave one star because I can't give negative stars." Don't get me wrong his prices are decent I just wasn't impressed on the fact that he did the living social deal just to get people in the door.  I went home and contacted living social and they refunded my $$$ and said that if this is what he did then he broke his contract with them and these are not the businesses they want to work with.  Again decent prices just didn't like how this deal was handled." My Fiancee and I purchased a king mattress and box springs  from Steve Berdrow. Steve was fast and efficient and save me hundreds of dollars from similar mattress and springs at Costco. I would highly recommend Steve and R&S mattress for your mattress needs. "Steve was extremely helpful! He can help you find the right mattress for an awesome deal. Local company  but the door was locked and no staff to be found at 11am on a Tuesday. We waited for about 10 minutes and then left."  the customer service help we got from Colin Gree was incredible! Not only did he take the time to show us the different types of bedding but he tool the time to explain the ""quality"" differences and what would be best for us! Thanks for all of your help Colin  within seconds of walking in the door I knew I had made the right decision by going there. Colin Gee was really helpful in educating me on different types of mattresses and options as well as how R&S is able to offer such discounted prices for the exact same mattresses sold elsewhere for up to double the price. I never felt like I was being sold or pushed into buying anything. I felt great about my purchase and will without a doubt buy from R&S next time I need a mattress. Also "If you are looking for a new bed look no more just go down to r&s on bell and ask for the mattress ninja Colin Gee this guy knows what is going on. Not only did he not pressure me in to buying but when I said I had to leave and but would be back after work he didn't fret he actually handed me a 100 dollar pillow and said I will see you when you get back!!!! And he did "Bought a mattress and delivery was scheduled a week later. We changed our mind to cancel it next day itself but they won't cancel it even though delivery date is still few days later. Avoid this place Yesterday I purchased mattress here and slept on it last night!  I was saved after 5 nights of no sleep thanks to American Furniture's screw up.  Colin made sure I got my mattress home last night and I'm eternally grateful!  He knows a lot about mattresses! Check it out!!! Great priced and service. Collin is like.  Dealing with a friend of the family. This is the third purchase in 3 years. I would refer friends and family.Collin more than salesman  and not pushy but very informed . Did not have what I was looking for at bell and 40th store but shipped from other store no problem. If you need a good quality mattress  they immediately resolved the issue the same day. Would highly recommend them for the customer experience alone." We shopped at numerous stores and ended up buying  at R&S Mattress! We continue to be happy loyal customers buying another mattress online from R&S! Thanks for providing a comfortable nights sleep and a custom mattress to fit both our needs for two people that like different comfort levels!
