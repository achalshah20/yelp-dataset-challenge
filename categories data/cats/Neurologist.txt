Overall- I refer everyone. Along with that I let them know that she's going to yell at you but instead of feeling insulted... laugh it's worth it." Be proactive in dealing with the staff (there are only two of them) and don't allow them to shift blame to you or others for their mistakes." That is old fashioned medical care and service. I haven't even been to the office yet and I am already giving five stars. Impressive."  if quality of care was the only component she would have 10 stars of out of 5 but scheduling is a misery.  When I can schedule an appointment at leisure I have resorted to fax a request since the voicemail is always full and it is so hard to get the staff to answer the phones.  The front office staff run hot and cold as well - sometimes caring and willing to go the extra mile for appointment coordination and at other times snarling.  I appreciate them as people and realize the stress they are under MR's review was spot-on. I've been seeing Dr. Shafran for almost (10) years. She will remind you of a Judge Judy. She may seem abrasive but she's a great doctor who does not like to see her patients in pain. Office staff work well together- what you see is what you get. Not for the meek at heart.  good luck reaching them on the phone. That I can live with though. What really upset me is the bill I received 2 months later for $7500 from an out of network urinalysis that Dr. Shafran had ordered without consulting me first. She asked me to pee in a cup which I thought was normal enough for a doctors visit. Next thing I know I'm getting billed for $7500 for around 30 drug tests off of about a shot glass of my piss. Luckily I had really good health insurance at the time and they ended up covering the cost even though it was out of network because I had no control over what had happened. I can't believe this office would send out a test that cost this much and was of absolutely no relevance to my case. Bottom line don't pee in the cup."
