After your all setup skate downtown or ride along the lightrail where you will find some sick spots." This is one of the best skateshops I've been to in my entire life. Very helpful and friendly bro's over there.  and received friendly service.  Cool shop.  Not really my thing these guys have been doing it proper since day one. best customer service and best selection of boards and gear. great people buy all my gear here and there great They Rule! I would walk over hot coals to get to this shop.  they had a couch and played skate videos all the time. You can't beat a 20$ blank deck. They always do the grip tape well too. Follow them on Instagram they always post what sales and events they have going on. Support Local Shops!!" Dope spot with sweeeeet rides and gear. Knowledgable folks who love the art of skating. Looking forward to future visits :D
