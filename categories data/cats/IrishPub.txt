 though very few will ever make it into the back room.  It's essentially a dead zone.  There's a fancy back bar that remains closed so that two bartenders can roost on top of each other like Master Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome and watch TV.  This kind of forces patrons to hover near the front.  So  slightly dingy neighborhood bar that is great for relaxing after work." Verdict: if you want a quick drink (and I mean ""drink  that any place that offers popcorn for $.25 is alright by me (better than having it sitting on the bar and you have no idea who has put their hands in there)."  but so what? It's got cheap beer and is an ok spot for a quiet pint. The front bar feels a bit grotty but the back is big and it's fine to hang out in. Nothing special but not terrible either."  this is your place. You will not receive angry stars from the regulars as you walk in and the bartenders are friendly.It's quite smoky though so be prepared to come out wreaking of nicotine."

Tell me Saw Tim Cauley there one time. We played billiards and darts together then we picked a song out on the jukebox. It was fun "It's a typical dark and smokey dive bar. I don't say this in a negative way. It is what it is. Drinks are reasonably priced. There's a jukebox and darts. Fun crowd  friendly staff and nice patrons. Everyone seems to know each other but they aren't rude to newcomers. It's within walking distance from my house so I'll definitely be coming back!"
