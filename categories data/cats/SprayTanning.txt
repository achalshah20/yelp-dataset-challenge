 so you just bop along for the 5-10 minutes you are laying there.  They run great specials all of the time that I receive via email or even on their Facebook page.  Tropical Tan has become my tanning joint of choice - great place!" "I just recently got a membership about two months ago. Prices are a bit high for what they offer I started going there around 2010 after the place I started going too closed after 2 months. Everyone is very friendly and the place is clean and well kept. I have tried many different products and always achieved a nice tan. Products are not cheap but they do run a lot of specials and let you know about them. I had an accident once when I hit my head on the corner of one of the beds. The owner immediately came and administered first aid. When I arrive I am always greeted and always told to have a good day when I leave. Linda and Caitlin have always made me feel welcome as a customer and so have the other employees. GREAT customer service! Not pushy and they are very educated. The Norvell Sunless booth is better than any other I've tried. Only place in the area with Norvell. The very best place to tan in Charlotte!! Great staff. Great beds. Great place to get a spray tan too!
