 you get the idea. This store is STUFFED full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced. It's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)" This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia. A party of a party and Pittsburgh store!"  this is the place for you because you'll more than likely find it...and walk out with more than you planned on getting!  But that's the fun of shopping here!"  the Party King does not work on weekends apparently! We decided before we left on Monday to take a quick gander thru the store - what a neat store with all your random party supplies. Lots of awesome tailgating party supplies. I can't say it any better than the reviews below - most random but necessary stuff!"  and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!" Something to note: you can only use a credit card if you spend more than $10  THEY HAVE IT!!!! they have an assortment of things and it's an amazing shop. They are real friendly and it's a great place to go to get party items!" Yes parking will be a problem but they are centrally located in the middle of some of the best shoppes and eateries along the strip. Check them out if you get a chance!"  this is the place to be. This store is mainly party goods. I was hoping to find more Steelers souvenirs. I struggled to find something to buy. In the end I wound up with two Pittsburgh snow globes and some gum."
