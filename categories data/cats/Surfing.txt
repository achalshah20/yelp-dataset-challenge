 skate and snow boards. Wallerbears reminds me of the surf shops back home in Florida....just without the beach nearby."  this was one of the shops that she and her friends liked to frequent.   Wallerbears is tucked away in the McMullen Creek Shopping Center (on Hwy 51).  They have a good selection of Rainbows & Reef flips and they also stock a pretty good selection of surfer apparel including shirts  so I don't really go there for the surf stuff.  I usually like to go and browse the snowboarding section.  The thing that I'm not too big of a fan of is that their women's snowboard section is a bit small.  There isn't that much for me to choose from.  Their customer service  blows Nordstrom out of the water... kids and adult sizes!  And Sanuks are hard to find... my husband loves them and so does my brother in law (who is a surgeon and on his feet all day).  They are also hip without being hipster :)  But Young Staff is good in a place like this you will probably get better information!  OK where is the Street Art???  What  they have a good return policy.  I purchased skateboards for my sons for Christmas and did so in peace because they do full refund on unused merchandise with receipt within 30 days.  I will be back.  They were also helpful in providing resources for skate parks and lessons and coaches.  I don't know enough about skateboards to rate the product
