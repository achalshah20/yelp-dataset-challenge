Best pizza in town but you have to pick it up.  Hut is so boring and Pizza Pit closed.  Kind of wierd that the best pizza in toen is from a gas station but it is good! "I NEVER thought I'd say that a pizza from a GAS STATION is the best in town...but there you have it.  It really is--hands down.  The crust is PERFECT: yeasty This is absolutely the best pizza in DeForest. Everyone there is always super friendly too!
