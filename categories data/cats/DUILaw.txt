"I hired Kevin Barnett 2 weeks ago to take care of multiple tickets for me.  I will recommend him to everyone I know.  His office is in a convenient location and he is incredibly easy to work with.  He has a great assistant KSy9KjeG0zuUWKNMgoMAQw  Mrs. Duckstein is the first and last call you need to make. Her attention to detail of your case  then go with Sonja! She will go above and beyond! I'm pleased with her services and wouldn't trust anyone else." Think you don't need an attorney? Shouldn't you know? Call her." I am a worker's comp and SS attorney here in Phoenix. I know Sonja and she is a fantastic lawyer - for both personal injury and criminal defense. She is very responsive and caring to her clients. I highly recommend her. "Sonja Duckstein is the epitome of a client first mentality.  Her work ethic is unmatched and her knowledge of the law including our rights as citizens is top notch. I trust to refer my family  and patiently answered my questions. They really treated me and my friend as more than a client and took a genuine interest in the overall outcome of the case. I can't thank you enough for your kindness and determination."
