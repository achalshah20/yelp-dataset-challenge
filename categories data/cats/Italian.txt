 but yelp won't let me.  So they get an undeserved star." Next time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly "I never even made it inside! After pulling into the parking lot and getting out of my car I was ""greeted"" by a HUGE bouncer who wanted to search me. If a pizza place needs a bouncer then it is NOT the kind of place I want to eat at. Must draw a dangerous crowd or something."  however he wanted to search me prior to entering.  I said no and turned around and left.  You may want to consider having the pizza delivered."  not chewy. The cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place. The sauce has spice but not too much. At some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue. Their one downside is that they're not always consistent. Some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done." "Eaten here twicebut only pizza. I do have to say its up there with Napolis or Ailleos as for the pizza. Tonight me and my neighbors were up for some more. Was disappointed when ordering a meatball hoagie to find out they had no meatballs! Pizza places should never run out of certain things. Had gotten a cheese hoagie. Didnt get get why someone would order this 100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients  but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try "Really great local pizza. Probably the best crust I've had in a while. Very inexpensive for Pittsburgh but you can taste quality ingredients. They don't have many specialty pizzas. So "This is a small takeout and delivery pizza shop in Morningside.  It has good pizza and salads and I presume the hoagies are also good but I have not tried them.  They doe a very good business and customers appear satisfied with a lot of repeat business.  It appears to be a local favorite.  I had avery good slice of pizza  cheese blend is just right. Delivery has been prompt each time. Definitely our fav neighborhood pizza delivery place."  this place is good-eatin' basic Italian food!  Not spectacular  and pepperoni!  Mm-mm good!  Gotta hit that gym tomorrow.  And you know the best thing about ordering pizza  traditional italian american food. The salads are good. The pizza is really great (I stopped ordering from anywhere else).  The veal cannelloni is awesome too."  and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry  we saw a certificate of excellence for being one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. In 1993." The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM  the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing "The food quality is good or not great. I do love the following. The anti-pasto is very good. I love there wedding soup. Don't write this place off due to some bad reviews "Minutello's is going out of business. Last day of operation is Sunday "This would have been 5 stars but they aren't as consistent as they once were. My order is usually always right..every time I get cheese lovers or extra cheese now a days it's never on there... There's only 1 delivery driver who will come into my apartment building and to my door. The others are for some reason scared and I have to meet them at the sidewalk outside! They tend to get very busy  they just ignroed me. About 10 minutes into my wait the cashier front store clerk came in through the back door with a handful of scratch off lottery tickets that he obviously just bought  but when my brother started eating his pizza and found a hair it made me so disgusted but I continued to eat it anyway. When I found a hair in my own separate pizza it made me absolutely sick and couldn't even finish my 2nd piece. I find it repulsive that obviously your cooks don't wear any hair nets since there were MULTIPLE HAIRS in my pizza. This was my first real meal since getting my wisdom teeth out 3 days ago so thanks for ruining that for me. Its safe to say i don't think I'll ever be ordering from this unsanitary "I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for my pizza to be delivered. Then when I got it Years from now we are going to learn on the news that the reason why they never took orders was because they only delivered to their friends who called them on their cellphones.  When they dropped off the pizzas we are going to find out they were dropping off drugs! At least this scenario makes sense." I won't do business with this store or any of the franchisee's stores again. The franchisee apparently is Aurora Huts LLC I believe they sell calzones and a few other things  but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst ""pizza"" I've ever had." I usually love this place but it's gone bad. Went to one in wv the other day and it was good. I think different owners. My beef this one is the cheese. Very pour quality. Bread and sauce still good though. PTkChuI3GPCw-ZL1Iph76A  but we were in Pittsburgh so I decided to stop and try this DiCarlo's out. I was not disappointed! Although it is in a dingy area and it doesn't have as many customers as Elm Grove does  crunchy crust and this is some of the best I've ever had" Turned on to it by a friend...I now live up the hill from it. The staff are great people and the quality of the pizza is amazing. Always get the rush hour 6 cut plain special. FYI now closed mondays. Great food. just be closed temporally Pizza hut fucking OWNS!  a pizza of last resort." Don't bother with delivery here. Carry out is your best bet." Tuesday night- first of the month- the manager handled a customer on the phone complaint  request with one of the best attitudes that I have seen in the fast food industry in a long time - Def will be coming back This is the worst location. Orders are consistently incorrect and rarely on time.    Asked for a refund due to order not even being made after 20 min  and I quote "" the problem is our driver took the wrong pizzas""  no shit genius.  His remedy was to have the driver go back and pick them up then deliver them to me...really?"  tick...Store is less than a mile away. Made the 2nd call. This time they admit he's only left 20 minutes ago. Unapologetic and pitiful. Now it's after closing time and I can't them to answer the phone to cancel." do not order from this place! really bad service! Food is ok but Horrible delivery service. They called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one. Hence didn't deliver the food and when we called to ask if you can't we can pick up the food they said we are closed and you can't do carry out as well. Horrible horrible service.  you won't be disappointed. Great place to grab a beer on Beverly road and catch up with old friends."  as are all of their fatty appetizers.  They also offer pasta and other options so there is something to please everyone in any size group you bring to Bado's." All of the staff here were very friendly and helpful. The fried zucchini appetizer was huge and very tasty.  The white thin crust pizza with spinach was very good.  Seemed like a great neighborhood restaurant and we will most definitely be going back.  the servers are true Pittsburgh and generally very sweet." "I live in walking distance so I have been here many times . The place is very clean and the menu has many choices ... Not just pizza and hoagies . The bar is well stocked and has many varieties of beer . I would suggest coming here for breakfast or brunch on the weekends . The omlettes are huge . The only drawback is the place very small and can get crowded . You can't have a discussion without hearing what the people sitting at the next table are talking about as well . There is sometimes a wait to get a table . Good place to take the family   no dinner entrees besides pasta   smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service."  and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there The one drawback for me is how it's a bit ""too"" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud  but they'll always give you samples! You can buy growlers full of good stuff for fairly cheap This is definitely going to become a staple of my Pittsburgh food experience!"  deep dish masterpiece. Their white pizza is also very good. Stick to the pizza here--the only other thing I had on their menu was a burger and it was not so good.  The bar is pretty cool - friendly bartender.  They are also very quick to deliver  but if you're local give it a go. If you want an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a beer  Our most popular crust)"" and the hot wings.  It did not take long and the pizza and wings came out.  The wings were hotter than most places and pretty good.  The pizza crust was a little thicker and nice flavor and chewy  and the bread was moldy. I gave this place a second chance and they failed. Gross.never again!" I was surprised initially to see an Italian Ale House. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was pretty good as well. It was a short visit to PA for me but I would recommend this to someone else looking for some decent Italian food and a decent bar. Loved trivia Wednesdays!  8-10 upstairs.  Everybody is welcome. "Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff  but it didn't stand out for me. The other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. The beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste  but I think the menu could use a little more inspiration." Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. They use a bread dough recipe handed down from their grandmother and a sauce that is to die for. Awesome beer selection as well. Word of advice from someone who's been dining here since they were across the street and known as Pizza Piazza - don't introduce yourself to the pizza via the lunch buffet - it's too delicate and dries out under the heat lamp. Order it fresh with extra sauce and enjoy!  so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b c it's worth it."  The bartender was a great guy and very good at his job." If I lived in the South Hills I would come here all the time. I am not even sure how the pizza place across the street stays in business. I suspect that after the locals are done getting hammered off of Bado's awesome beer selection they need to order some crap when homebase has closed. Or it is a front for the mob. "Bado's is a nice place to go to get decent food. Pretty average as far as I've seen so far. The reason for 3 stars is that the bar is small and the beer is over priced. I understand it's micro and craft beers on tap but there are other places near by with the micro and crafts for less with better atmosphere. Big plus to the bartenders though "This is some of the best american style pizza anywhere. Smaller kvECetuoMJ-LEYzHmyP0RA  Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours We'll be back when we're in the area.  I see this being a regular spot after our rounds of golf at Mt. Lebanon GC." "I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection Love Bado's. Any pizza is really good and their rueben is very tasty. Lots of beer choices and they give out free samples. got the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to .  they hide the sour cream underneath the cheese so it can't be seen until it's too late. This can be quite a shock for those who prefer their skins condimentless." Large bar food menu and great selection of draft beers. Patio open in the summer and decent size restaurant. Large portions on food. Great Sicilian and speciality pizzas. i would never eat here again"  it's now about 15 bucks.  Their wings you can make at home better.  Swordfish on my salad wasn't cooked right (they probably shouldn't be serving that if they don't have top chefs).  Lastly  but were tasty (& I'm not a big fan of french fries). The pizza that my wife & our company ordered looked very good." Chili cheese omlette was amazing!  Great home fries and toast as well. Its gotta be the only place in town to watch early sporting events while eating breakfast. Service was very attentive.  My coffee cup never got below half full.  the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall The staff could have been a little friendlier  hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!" Yummy yummy pizza!!! Excellent beer choices! The service was great. Everyone was personable. The wait was a little long and there is nowhere to stand yo wait but that is my on complaint. I would def go back. "Great place to have a party!  Bado's is located in a cute section of Mount Lebanon with street parking or a metered parking lot in the back (it was only $5 for a 24 hour period).  Our friends rented out the top part of the restaurant for a 30th birthday party. This was a large space which could easily fit over 50 people comfortably.  There was a small bar with 3 draft beers to choose from The service is a little off and the staff doesn't seem very attentive to your needs. However the food is worth having bad service. They have a great selection of pizzas but my personal favorite is the buffalo chicken. We've never had any problems with the service or the food I will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However  the lunch pizza buffet left ALOT to desire. It was literally a few cold pizzas layed out on a little table. No salad I always get burgers and beer here even though they're known for their pizza. No regrets! Love their growlers too!  but a little pricy. A 4 cut is more than enough two people.  It's a good place for families and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. They have good specials do keep those in mind!"  they offer a "" Pittsburgh Sandwich "" they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks  not very crowded (pre-MNF game time) and we ordered a 12 inch regular crust pepperoni with extra cheese and garlic pizza. It was incredible! The service was good and the waiter was very informative. The atmosphere was good. I recommend this pizza for dine in or carry out."  it is outrageously expensive. As in $45 for a medium one topping and a large two topping. That is insane. This is not including tip or anything else. Their wings are ok "The margarita pizza is the best! It's a great little spot with a bunch of beer choices  although the chicken strips were the best thing in the whole order. The turkey grilled sandwich also had no lettuce or tomato and was greasy and soggy and did not come with the chips and pickles as listed on the menu. For what they charged for this. It was a disgrace . We will not order again and will pass the word around. There are too many other  decent and less expensive delivery restaurants to ever order from there again. Disappointed." "Margarita pizza - best fucking pizza I've ever ate! End of story. On my commute home from work; will be eating one weekly. Just at 8 of 12 pieces. Time for power nap (8 hours) then wake up   we ordered Wings with 2 unique sauces.  We tried the Guiness Honey Mustard and the Butter Garlic sauces.  Both sauces were very good  relevant craft beers and good food. This evening was no exception." Definitely worth checking out!" Great little bar and pizza restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. I went for dinner her on Friday night and was not disappointed. They had a good beer list and the food was delicious. I had their onion rings and regular crust pizza. Will definitely be making this my pizza and beer go to. "Chose Bado's on a whim. Worst waitress ever. Couldn't remember anything. Husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce. It was runny and bland. I ordered the veggie burger We have had really wonderful experiences with this place along with really terrible ones. The same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same. I ordered the same burger twice and it came different and not great the second time. The fries were ways very soggy and cold. We would keep ordering from them if we knew we could be paying for what we expected. I want so badly to like this place!! "Back in my coaching days at Chartiers Valley this was one of my goto places in Lebo. The pizza is good That all said though I had a fun time at Bado's and I'll go back." They always have a full house. There is no where to wait for your table."  but it's worth it.  I love their rotating beer menu as there's usually something to keep me happy. The service is always good as well. We usually sit at the bar so the bartenders know us well.  Bado's gets two thumbs up from this girl!"  and friendly bar tenders. You can't beat having wings and beers at the bar on a game day." The pizza is very good and the beer selection is great. The restaurant needs to improve on service. In the last two visits I received the wrong food and this time I had to get another drink at the bar because my waiter went missing for 15 minutes.  and wings are pretty good too. BUT the last three times the staff has been awful. I'm not usually one to complain "Great beer selection and the food is good. My gripes are that it's always so loud in there that I have to shout across the table The booth we sat in was broke but no issues other than that.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza was amazing.  The server was friendly too. She did forget our drinks which was no big deal. Love this place pizza! Breadsticks! I always get pizza from here. Everything's made in house. I hope as good for you as it is for me. Why I will never return?"  because I won't be back. No pizza is worth the experience we had here."  but it would still be nice to have some acknowledgement beyond food order and check. Other than that the pizza is pretty good (although not my favorite in the area) and the lunch time buffet is a great bargain."  I'd be at A'Pizza Badamo on Washington.  My daughter who is a pizza fanatic only had a slice and a half before calling it quits - she's the expert and it says volumes when she won't eat more than a slice and a half.  The kids tried and rejected the pasta we got them to try as well as there was no taste to the sauce.  All in all  it is very small pieces. The bread sticks however are so soft and warm and very delicious! Their Italian hoagie and Italian calzone lack flavor. These items are all I have ever had here and they do require more spices as everything (except the bread sticks) is pretty bland. They are also kind of pricey so we do not go here often because of that. Our service is usually pretty good I haven't had a Reuben for years (too much salt) but they were very good here in the past."  but there was no getting around it: the pizza was really bad by any standard." Overall the pizza was excellent I would like to see how it tasted with the actual Sicilian crust" 3 stars for the time in which this was delivered. Right on time 30mins. The pizzas were just warm and overall PizzaHut pizzas lost their taste.  Very bland and unappetizing. the manager then called me back and said he believed his driver was lying and he was - as a courtesy to me - going to rewarm my two hour late pizza in the oven and send it over to me as soon as possible." Thanks for a great pizza Friday!!" The food and service were very good . The food is made from scratch on premises . The restaurant is owned and run by two brothers from the Green Tree area . I admire this and always try to give my business to local family run places like this . My only gripes are the limited selection at the bar and I feel the prices for food are very expensive for the portions you receive.  I ordered the chicken club and customized it with a side of coleslaw. My better half had the fish sandwich with a coleslaw as well. The food came like the wind Nice family run spot for lunch if you are in the area.  Good service at a decent price.  loved their onion rings. The English style scrod is very good also. The Big Lebowski was on when we came here and people were dressed up like the movie's characters. It looks like a ski lodge on the inside. Service was acceptable." Management - you really need to update the place." When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place jrSGpWnVJy8jqgN6XSC7Nw I decided to stop in and get my meal to go as I was fresh off of a construction site and my attire did not match the surroundings or the current clientele. I ordered a shrimp scampi appetizer and a fettucini fro diavlo. When I got the food back to the hotel Been coming here for 30 years or so.  Always good food at a good price.  Great service.  Nice variety. covered patio. Excellent quick service. My husband I split the fried zucchini and white pizza with chicken. Loved it "We checked this place out because it was close to our hotel and it was one of the few non-chain restaurants we saw.  The service was very friendly. The food was just okay.  I ordered the fettuccini alfredo with lump crab and they said the sauce is freshly made in house Real nice place. People nice and food great. Nice homemade salad dressings. On business so was a good choice. Will come back  and it's not hard to imagine they were the neighborhood ""fancy"" dining establishment back then. Food was decent and the staff was friendly. I have no complaints and I would probably eat here again if I was in the area." Super fast service NY style crust pizza was great and crispy.  clean local place in Green Tree. Might be a little pricey but the food is good and homemade." Just read my review of Bados and you got this place . No breakfast here though but this place has two things Bado's doesn't . 1. a great deck to eat and drink 2. Free parking .  and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed" I'm usually in Pittsburgh once a year and each time I come to town I typically have Vincents. Their NY Style thin crust pizza is just awesome and the service is typically pretty good. Regular crust is good as well if you want  something a little bit thicker.  very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit." And the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean  but pizza we got anyway. And WOW! Enter a seafood variation on the detested entree. I have tried seafood pizza at various places before and received imitation ""crab"" and some mini shrimp sauteed in butter KZXtzoI84iI1CEcAnD7OPA  the service was fine - no major issues.  Good place for casual dining and good bar food." xb6zEQCw9I-Gl0g06e1KsQ  fair service. A+++ for the muffaletta. If you go there and don't try this sandwich it's your loss."  but good food if you don't mind the wait or check."  Vincent's of Greentree is one of the better pizzas in the Pittsburgh area." Food is mediocre service is lousy. I'm sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for 20 min... The portions are Huge. I ordered half of the antipasto salad and it was still enough that I was satisfied. They should cut up the meat as it was slices of deli meat thrown into the salad though was a very good salad overall. I also ordered wings and was very impressed with these. It is hard to find the right wings that have the right amount of meat to breading mixture. They even make for a good treat on day 2. A friendly patron bought me a cannoli which was amazing. This was my second visit to Vincents and I look forward to a third. Service was good but probably the worse pizza I've ever had.  We couldn't eat it. Friendly staff . I ordered a Italian Hoagie and my wife had Spinach Ravoli. Waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. My hoagie was dry with min meat. Bun was OK. My wife liked her salad. Both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. Probably wont go back." I had the buffalo chicken pizza and really enjoyed it! Good quality cheese and chicken.. Hearty proportions.. No complaints ! So I walked in 20 minutes before closing and the waitress welcomed me right in with no problem.  I tried their pizza that i enjoyed mainly because of the fresh ingredients and hard crust.  They had a nice size patio which I will be back to sit with my friends next time I'm in Pittsburgh. "Great place!! Tried a different bar in town and was highly disappointed by it so we tried this place and we love it!! The only problem is We drove past twice trying to first figure out where the restaurant is (from the address you think it's on the other side of the street) and then how to enter the parking lot. But we found a spot okay once we managed to get there." Just moved to the area so I am looking for a go to spot. Vincents isn't going to be it. The food wasn't great it was just ok. I had the italian sausage. The prices are reasonable and I got my food in a timely manner but no personal customer service. I sat at the bar and literally no attempt to have any dialogue except get my order. No other options ill go back but that's it. Or I may try pizza and have it delivered. Visit two was much better! We started with the homemade hot stuffed peppers which were phenomenal! I had to make myself stop eating to save room for dinner. We ordered spaghetti with meatballs and pollo divino pizza. The peppers were the shining star of the meal! Second would be the pizza because it was interesting and delicious. We ordered with white sauce and it perfectly complimented the chicken and cheddar. The overall spaghetti was okay but the meatballs really made it slightly above ordinary."  but service was pretty slow considering how many servers were working. We ordered the artichoke hearts to start - I recommend staying away from those! They were around $9 and had obviously just come from a can and had some Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The rest of the food Best pizza in the area Italian subs are good quality Service was A1 but ya gotta watch out for the Psycho dishwasher or busboy every 2 minutes this guy comes strolling past our table cracking his knuckles giving us the Evil Eye really weird "One of my standby restaurants when I'm in the Green Tree area of Pittsburgh. Small Italian calzone would be plenty to share between two people. Their wedding soup is very good and I recommend it. Good Italian food for those that tire of Olive Garden or Fazoli's.  In nice weather We love their pasta fagoli on Fridays.  There were 6 of us and the staff was very attentive.  All of the food was great and we liked sitting upstairs. "Pizza was good but really expensive. I also got a 6 pack that cost 14 dollars. The same 6 pack cost 7.50 back in my hometown.  When it was all said and done our pizza  so I feel as though it's a good idea to hire people who act like they like customers and want to make them feel welcome. I did not feel the love here. The wine & beer selection is very narrow My only suggestion to people coming here for lunch is it is busy and you will wait.  So if you only have 30 minutes for lunch  and they treated us like it was prime dinner time. Food was delicious- all three of us had pasta dishes with salad. Their little rolls are the best. Homemade food. Our waitress was great and treated us wonderful. Would go back again- next time we won't have to be so late."  the knuckleheads in the kitchen are unorganized. You would be smart to take the time to look things over before you leave. Once you get home Enjoyed a dinner with colleagues at Vincent's in Green Tree.  Nice evening outside on the deck and service was quick and courteous with good recommendations.  The two favorites at the table were the Mediterranean Salad and the pizza.  I would definitely recommend dinner at Vincent's if your looking for a sports bar atmosphere.  is high for a pizza and salad.  The wait staff were friendly and on the day we went the place was very busy with a party upstairs. The wait staff apologized for delays and served us as quickly as they could. Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try another pizza place." I would definitely order here again." It was so unsatisfying. And the service just was disappointing  but not nearly enough garlic.  House Chianti rates a C.   Atmosphere of a road house.  Service was peachy.  Prices good.  Would definitely go back."  trust me try it. I always get the Chicago style pie. It's not a deep dish with the sauce on top. It's more like a ""Pittsburgh Chicago pizza"" with thick crust and tons of cheese. I love it with fresh mushrooms  it's bought in. I've eaten gnocchi from coast to coast my grandmother made it for us  nothing fancy. The pizza was great and they have a decent selection at the bar. This place is just what i needed close to survive a week alone on business."  I've found the service to also be consistent in that when I've dined in they are very slow (even when not busy) and uninterested. I've had this same experience when ordering take out. They seem like I'm bothering them when I go in and ask for my order."  and it's just overall a really nice place. We were so happy with our rehearsal dinner at Vincent's. We had the upstairs dining room all to ourselves and it was the absolute perfect place. Did not disappoint at all. In addition to great food and service  the thing I love the most is the crust on their calzones. Most of the time at other pizza joints your calzone is soggy in the middle and the crust is overdone on the bottom. Somehow at Vincent's they have perfected the art. I once got a to go box "Sat outside and had a great dinner.  The food was delicious and the service was very good.  It's very close to hotels r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA  heh. They have some Shakies behind the counter if you ask. Expect to wait if you stop while bar hopping and actually even finding a parking spot family owned and operated  the sauce has a slightly sweet tang and the cheese is delicious! I live in Oakland and make excuses to go to the south hills just so I can have Fiori's pizza." No credit cards. ATM onsite." Used to be a devout Mineos kind of guy but I have been converted to Fiorism.   Just love the cheese and crust. best pizza in the south hills.  possibly in the city.  old style pizza shop with a get it and get the hell out of the way atmosphere.  my mouth is watering right now just thinking about this place...  the atmosphere neighborhood isn't exactly my idea of ""five star""" "Fiori's is always great pizza - especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry.  It's open late "i highly recommend this pizza.  i'm a fan of several different pizza styles and this is a good old medium crust style.  it's more on the side of ny style pizza with that medium sized crust.  i tried a large mushroom with half pepperoni.  they bury the pepperoni under the cheese (minus one star).  i prefer seeing the pepperoni because of the fact we only wanted half the pizza with pepp and couldn't tell which side was which.  we had leftovers and i wasn't as big of a fan of the cold pizza from here.  i will say though I love pizza and this is AMAZING!! It has a sweeter sauce (which I love!)...  and great mozzarella cheese... I order the pizza well done because it is a little softer and that makes it much better! I dare someone to try this and not love it... The workers and always super fast and completely on top of everything... The only downfall is that the pizza is a little more expensive over other pizza places... but it's worth it! A south hills legend.  The only problems are a total lack of parking and long wait but a great pizza if you can be patient.  be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork." "Hands down the best thing about living in Brookline is the close proximity to Fiore's.  Unlike most pizzerias  grew up with it and still miss it to this day. If you don't like grease...don't come in the door. This is for pizza people." "I LOVE Fiori's. The thought of their slices makes me drool. I can't think of a more perfect pizza anywhere. The pizza sauce is so deliciously sweet I live in california now and NO ONE can make pizza like Fiori!!! mmmmmm The place itself has a perfect old school been-in-the-neighborhood-for-years vibe with a couple of tables and booths.  Unpretentious.  Neighborhood.  Open Late.  Perfect." I grew up eating this.   Any time I'm on west liberty I stop and get a slice.  Great family owned business.   Sweet cheese.  but I get so excited to eat the best pizza. Sacramento pizzarias have nothing on Pittsburgh's. Fiori's is the best pizza I've ever eaten. It's local so my dad grew up eating the stuff & so did I until I moved to California. Sweet sauce and thin crust baked to perfection. If you're in Pittsburgh  nothing but the finest ingredients and 100% consistent!" 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ  this place is quite amazing!!!!  The thin crust and sweet sauce were a perfect combination for this pie.  We ordered cheese slices and they hit the spot for a bit of a hang over from the Steeler game the night before.  I will come back to this spot every time I am in town.  Very good customer service r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA "My fave pizza near the burgh.  The sauce is so unique... it's sweet and delicious.  I like the wings here too.  I don't know why.  I just like the combo of hot wing sauce with sweet pizza sauce.  Located in a weird spot up a hill  but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold I know! I know! this place is popular  and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big Great Pizza and Subs. 45 minutes for take out pizza when their busy  atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters  holy crap steep hill for parking on! You could probably park elsewhere 5) ATM inside cash only"  my boo brought home a slice the other day and it smelled like heaven. Iced tea in a carton? You cannot beat that."  the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me this was the best Pittsburghese Pizza out there r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA  then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit   debit card - a huge downfall for me." My favorite pizza in the city...the crust and sauce are sweet. AND YOU CAN BUY SLICES.  Imagine that."  if someone asks if it's worth it? The answer is always a resounding ""YES!""" "Stifled my pizza fix but I found the sauce a little too sweet.  The place was packed so they are clearly doing something right.  Employees behind the counter were very friend  but it's their meatball pizza that is truly out of this world! It has sweet sauce on incredibly soft and delicious crust with fantastic meatballs  I'd consider it one of the best pizza joints in the city. Extra cheesy! I'll definitely be back again. Parking  on the street is a bit tight Best pizza in Pittsburgh. Great old school owner as well. Their pasta is really good too. Assuming you enjoy their sweet sauce. Not a big fan of their hoagies but they're acceptable. ***man beaten killed outside Fioris(seen on twitter)  http:  www.post-gazette.com local city 2016 05 18 Police-investigate-1 stories 201605180164  ***" Maybe the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you want to see how pizza is supposed to taste give them a try. If you live near them and you haven't tried their pizza you probable live under a rock and don't deserve this delicious pizza. Also the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better that way We will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on."  Over half the tables were taken and would say the atmosphere was what you would expect from a pizza place. It took a while for the pizza but as soon as it was sat down I grabbed a slice and stuffed it in my mouth  we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie "Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet I love this place. I grew up in Beechview and moved away to Maryland. Every time I am in town I have to get their pizza! No pizza joints like this in Baltimore  come to Fiori's. No one knows food like a Fat Kid Fiori's is the best pizza I have ever had & I can't believe some of these people that have given negative reviews!! I don't know how some of the other pizza places near by even stay in business with fioris in the area!! I love this pizza & I wish they would open up more locations so even more people could enjoy this wonderful pizza!  and had the large pizza with sausage.... Okay the cheese they use in the pizza is really odd tasting to me it's just got this bitter taste maybe Parmesan mixed in? They made mozzarella sticks same way I couldn't finish them.... The ravioles were fine... Garlic bread... Ughm nothing special... Bland bread with butter and cheese.... And for the pizza... The cheese and sauce were just weird the sauce was very sweet almost like what a previous comment stated ""sugary"" and I guess with the bland bread and it all kind of evens out in a way... Haha ...."  and a crust that's not too thick or too thin.  Just absoultely great pizza." Pizza is to die for... Love getting the cold cheese on top of my cooked pizza hard to find parking but the pizza and sandwiches are really good and not greasy.  they sell slices of pizza and its really good the cheese taste like its high quality and kinda sweet. its cheap to and the sandwiches come in 2 sizes i ordered the smaller version and it was still too big. the portions are huge. "Is this the best Pizza in Pittsburgh? Maybe? Does it have some of the longest waits and poor parking. You betcha "This has got to be one of my favorite places for Pizza in all of Pittsburgh!  When a pizza place does not have to deliver or even have a convenient place to park to pick up your carry out order The only downside to Fiori's is the parking. It can be frustrating at busy times. Although parking can be tricky  is quite a different experience than eating it after its sat in a box for 15-20 minutes.   Not that it sucks by the time you get it home....Its just waaayyy better right out of the oven.  Its a signifigant difference in flavor and texture. ORDER EXTRA SAUCE If a place can make me go to an ATM for cash (they don't accept cards I knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy." "Just had my first pizza from Fiori's.  It was a really cool experience with some employees speaking Italian.  Parking was a little tough but that was the only issue.  It was busy because of it's popularity.  The pizza came out and I was a fan of the sweet tomato sauce.  All in all  Rome and Venice. This is the best pizza in the world  maybe the paint color on the walls and a few faces.             Best of all is when Fiori says ""We'll Fix-a you up!"" and he means it!!!!" Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.  I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING  dive spot pizza. Not much space and not much to see These guys are AMAZING!  The food is great and everyone there is so welcoming and hospitable.  Went twice on my last trip in and each time the staff looked as though they really enjoyed themselves.  and was quick for that.  There aren't many tables and the place is small.  If you're looking for a nice dine-in experience r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA Best pizza in the Burgh. No doubt. "I absolutely love this place. everything I've ever had is delicious. the service is great "Fantastic pizza. I've been on a good Pittsburgh pizza hunt. This place is now in the top of my list. Affordable Best Fu*king Pizza in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and try this. FYI. Cash only. But they do have an ATM The best pizza in the burgh! I was raised form New York and a very particular taste for pizza. While this isn't new York style it is very good. The only one that rivals the taste is Pizza Sola. The crust is thin and the cheese is creamy. It has a great flavor. My only problem is that it's cash only! It's the 21 century get with the program! Their cheese pizza is a must have if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Period. It's where all the locals go and you should too!  especially for it not being part of chain. (Ive become a bit of snob after working for one.) This place is small with lines that go out the door. Has a small sitting around with about 8 tables ;a fresh coat of paint wouldnt hurt this place. Menu has a lot to choose from with several toppings and sub sandwiches. The wait wasnt too long. The pizza itself is massive  two of the more decorated pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Fiori's gets extra credit for using the small spicy pepperonis and always having a pinball game in the corner!" You're welcome folks." I called from Georgia and ordered a extra Large pizza to be delivered to Childrens Hospital to friends that had a daughter in the hospital. The girl that took my order was very nice and gave me great service. The family told me that the pizza was great! I will call and use them again! "Best pizza in the burgh! Are favorites are plain r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA They've get a line out the door. They must be doing something right."  sausage and mushrooms. It was VERY busy on a Saturday night but we got our food in a reasonable time. I suggest ordering to go  which in my mind means the pepperonis should be pretty much covering the pizza and YES I realize that they were under the cheese but just not enough. Waiting for the pizza to cool down helped the topping slide problem a bit "Fiori's Pizza is so good! It is a very small little place if you want to eat in there but many people take pizza to go. The crust is like a sourdough like bread and it is so good. The sauce is a little sweet  I was not expecting much but wow was I wrong.  This pizza is so good! The crust is always cooked perfectly and there is tons of cheese.  It's a must have every time we are back in Pittsburgh!" "Good little pizza place. The sauce is somewhat sweet like others have said "My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door  any place with this much hype and known for its fresh ingredients yet uses canned mushrooms is f**ked." If they would deliver they would put all other pizza joints out off business in the south hills...it is that good. We are regulars :)  they continue to expand within the Pittsburgh area and introduce people outside of the south hills to their delicious product." Grew up on Fiori's pizza and Hoagies!  Just love it and Staff that have been there for years!  Consistent and yummy! Live out of town now but I call in an order as I approach the city! Pretty good pizza but  I don't like the inside seating and that they are cash only. "I have been eating here since I was 6 years old and every time we come back into town to visit this is the first stop we make. Incredible and best pizza Best pizza in the Burgh and the Italian salad is amazing..The wings are great also..When ppl come in from out of town I make sure they have a Fioris pie before they leave You'll thank me later"  but perhaps a bit pricey. They're fried to order and give me a reason to wake up in the morning. I always go for a white pizza with tomato on top "Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say ""I love fioris"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!" I am giving it a 4 out of 10." I love this pizza. The crust is a thin crust. The sauce is slightly sweet. The servers are always friendly. "This is as close that you can get to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pizza that we all knEw and loved as kids. Let the pie cool down for 10 minutes before eating so the cheese is nice and sticky. Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh  they were very busy and maybe just rushed. I will probably go back to try the other hoagies." Top 5 pizza in Pittsburgh. The only thinkg I don't like about it is the toppings slide off. "Excellent Pizza. Joe always makes it the way I like it Easy Cheese and green peppers. Great dough  I have made it my mission to find the best pizza joint.  It hasn't even been close.  Fiori's is the best.  I love the pepperoni pizza. It's perfect. Just delicious." "One of my Pittsburgh favorites as far as pizza goes. When I am on the Eastside Mineos is the spot  in my humble opinion ; )  It's cheesy and doughy w  a sweet sauce...it's just all kinds of goodness!  Take-out is great The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.  Now if they can only do something about the parking situation outside." "Fiori's lives up to the hype that it has around Pittsburgh! Pizza is classic and delicious and I love that they offer cold cheese on the side which is a personal favorite for me! One negative  probably in the country! I've been eating here all my life and when I moved away 7 years ago it was one of the things I missed most. Every time I come into town it is my first and last stops Definitely the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've eaten plenty of pizza. Nothing compares to fioris. I would absolutely recommend this place. Little costly for the pizza but you get what you pay for and it is worth it." Meatball hoagie was very good. Pizza is over-rated r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA  just amazing.  The crust is great and the sauce is just sweet enough to make...simply the best pizza in Pittsburg." r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA The best pizzas in Pittsburgh! I love the pepperoni pizza they make here nowhere else makes a better pie. It is always busy on the weekends and you have to wait but I don't care because it is so worth it. I have try a lot of places in town and nobody comes close . I am looking for another place to get pizza! But there is no better place. We like everything you make. Love this place. Staff are great and the pizza is always yummy ! Can't wait to go back Definitely one of the best pizza spots in all of Pizzaburgh.  They have a sugary sauce that goes well with their cheese.  I have eaten here several times. "Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. But parking absolutely sucks and I so wish that they delivered. But they're always busy. If you've never had Fiori's Pizza "Saw all the great ratings so I ended up checking this place out on two separate occasions during the evening. Bought two slices of pizza on the first go-around and two subs on the second go-around. Not really getting what the hype is about concerning their pizza since it tasted ... just like any generic pizza. Cheese was gooey Hope to try one of their hoagies at some point as well." There's a few tables and some old-skool arcade games. There's an ATM inside the establishment."  and Shelly Pie Pizza. I intend to try all the best pizza on offer in the city There's a few tables inside there but this is more like a fast food pizza joint. Great if you just want a quick slice to eat or getting take out!"  and no parking... Deffinately better than their second location but both are good!!!!"  and buffalo wings! Large portions. reasonable prices! This place is the real deal in Pittsburgh!" I have just been there today (Monday) for the first time. I called and placed an order of 6 wings and a slice of cheese pizza for take out. When I got there 11:45 am the place was already packed. I told them I forgot to tell them I wanted garlic parm of wings  when I ordered.  They said if you don't choose  flavor they automatically make buffalo. That was  fine with me since it was my fault not mentioning it. They asked me if I could wait for 15 min while they re make my wings.  I didnt want to wait so I asked them to just add butter and parm on my wings which they kindly did for me. After I got home I opened the package. There were 8 PCs of wings. How sweet of them !!!  The pizza and wings were very good. I will definitely go  back to order my favorite garlic parm next time.  especially after an evening of delicious "I wish I can leave 20 stars best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down just a bit greasy (note This place is amazing. Not a better place to stop and grab a quick slice in the city. True NY style pizza. Best part is it's really cheap! I'm in and out for $5 every time. I wish they delivered!! Yummy!!!! We try a lot of pizza places in Pittsburgh...this by far has the best...the cheese pizza is perfect itself! I love the cheese and the sauce has a sweet taste!!! Only complaint  is the largest size is a large which is 10 pieces! Fiori's has the best pizza in Pittsburgh in my opinion. I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and have traveled all around Pittsburgh to try as many pizza shops as possible. There are many goods ones but Fiori's still stands on top. A sweet sauce and the perfect blend of cheese and crust makes this pizza unmatched.  Fiori's is a great option.  At a party with friends just up the teeth rattling hill from Fiori's.  Called and ordered 10 pizzas in many styles.   They gave us a time and sure enough they were ready on time.  The pizza was a hit and all but a few slices were finished.  The sauce is a little sweet but it was good and the crust was cooked just right."  stop by Fiori's for a pie that will leave you coming back for more!" "First time trying them out since moving to the area. Ordered some hot wings for pick-up  calzones and hoagies for almost 30 years sometimes 2 times a day. The dough is perfect and the sauce is remarkable. Parking can be a challenge but to go is always a good option. The Italian salad is also a tasty option. The best pizza ever." "some of the best pizza in the city "If your from Pittsburgh and have never had Fiori's shame on you (especially if your from the South Hills). I don't need to elaborate Simply the best! Good prices good food and friendly staff. Never a bad slice of pizza there. We get their take out cheese pizza.   I'm from NYC so I know good pizza.   This is the best  yes it is Ok to travel outside the comfort zone and checkout this outside pizza treasures (Vincent's Rt. 30 inclusive)"  as this pizza is at it's best when it's piping hot.  I swear they've had the same gents working there since I've been going for over 15 years." "The pizza is super greasy but it really is some of the best. Most cheap pizza in Pittsburgh tastes like cardboard and everyone seems to like it. Fiori's is actually worth tasting. I don't have to put toppings on it in order to stomach eating it- that's the true mark of a good pizza! The sandwiches are decent as well r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA Best pizza in Pittsburgh. The crust is fluffy. The sauce is sweet. There prices are reasonable. There should be one of every corner of America.  pizza is subjective. It was definitely tasty and I'd go back the next time I'm in the neighborhood. But I have yet to find pizza in Pittsburgh that seems worthy of the ""Best Of"" title. Fiori's Im a fan of the sauce ...the cheese ..and the experience ...It has the mojo an original and as far as i remember its just as it was 25 years ago .... So these are the kind of unique establishments that deserve ...the hype. They pack em in.  Moving the line with pizzas flying out like no other ive seen ..in my life .. So even when busy expect the line too move .. I can say this it hasnt been refined and if so ..i could be here suggesting 5 stars if so....  they have had the it factor much like betos ..and they both deserve 5 ...for just staying the course with originality ...Have i had better well lets just say ...keep doing what your doing they love yah ...  fries and hoagies all good here. Love the buffalo sauce on the side as well."  this is the real deal.....New York style in da burgh. the little hole in the wall Bar next door owns Fiori's as is way cool. You can bring your Pizza over and have a cold one while you watch local yokels in Steelers t-shirts play pool and talk about past glory's gone by!" "Fiori's is consistently the best pizza in town! The consummate convergence of crust r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA  it's all absolutely worth it. The sturdy crust and gooey cheese help put this place in my top 3 pizza places. The pepperoni sends the pizza into another dimension Hands-down this is one of the best pizza shops in Pittsburgh from the cheese the dough the sauce all the ingredients are fresh and I have never been disappointed there yet never any surprises they are consistent and always delicious. "Yum. Honestly who can go to this place and not like the food? It's just phenomenal pie! Heck it's damn good. Go grab a pie  the service was excellent; and our pizza was in front of us in about 10-15 minutes. The sauce was great with the pepperoni hiding and sharing flavor beneath the cheese that came away in those hanging shreds as we lifted the slices to our plates. I like a little thinner crust always heard about this place.finally out in the south hills and tried it.very good pizza.would give 5 stars but pulling out of lot sucks Just need to improve the seating situation"  perfect melted cheese on top. Great flavor great quality. The tomato sauce was the lowest score that is why get 4 and not 5 stars. Still it's a great pizza. Eat up." My favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh. Good fast service.  and there is enough cheese on these pies to clog your arteries for the next 50 years. The best  but I would not recommend ordering their mozzarella sticks - less than stellar and for such a simple food item  the sauce sweet. Pepperonis are under the cheese. I could eat an 8 cut by myself. This place is popular and gets busy. I suggest calling ahead to place your order if you want to dine in. Parking is difficult  I've eaten at Fiori's at least one day per week for lunch since I worked close to that location. Like their motto says I have eaten pizza all up the coast . I never been to NY so that being said this is some of the best pizza one can find. No one can make hives and calzones like them. When I am back home from GA I have to eat here at least twice the week I am in because I never know when I am going to get a good pizza again This place can get pretty crowded and parking is very sparse so make sure you have someone that can run in and pay while you either drive around or wait." The owner must be a big sports fan.  If you like bobble-heads and sports figurines you can see so many...maybe all that have ever been given out in the burg."  which looked like it was about a month old and tasted pretty bad as well.  Only had a bite of that and threw it away.  I will never order from there again!" If you are in the area and looking for a good pizza this is a good place to get your pizza.  The shop still has mucho sports figurines and sports memorabilia on the walls." This is always a good choice for pizza!!" "Best pizza we've found in the South Hills.  Not fancy but service was great (owner's daughter) and the pizza was just right.  Lots of toppings.  Good crust.  Definitely a place to go back to.  They also deliver in the general area.  You can bring you own beer and can get it next door if you want.  Only about ten tables but reminds me of an old local pizza place with good food owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall  this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride."  it wasn't terrible but wasn't notably better than any others I've had. We also got an order of 10 hot wings. They were also extremely  greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce. Their texture was rubbery and they had a ""reheated"" taste to them. They were pretty terrible. We won't be ordering from here again." This was our second time eating the pizza from here. They are two doors Down from McNeilly Six Pack Shop. You can get food from here and take it to the six pack shop and eat it while you have a few beers. The pizza is in my top 5. The crust isn't too thick or too thin. They put more toppings on pizza than any other place that I know. But you have to have a good foundation to build on and hopefully not using toppings to cover a bad pizza. This pizza would be great even if it was just a plain cheese pizza. Now that I am hooked on their pizza I need to try other menu items. There's a reason my rating isn't too harsh. I don't like knocking hometown pizza joints. I'm sure their regular pan pizza is as good as everyone says Great pizza place especially for take out or delivery. Excellent pizza and excellent wings.  but the best are the steak wedges. Great prices not like some pizza place who cost a lot more than these guys but don't taste as good. I will be coming back here" Will have to eat in soon to find out more."  doughy crust (reheated well the next morning too). The waitress was super nice too. Will definitely be our go-to pizza joint!"  bubbly and lite. Tried the steak wedgie and it was delicious! The only thing I would recommend is asking them to go light on the lettuce. Way too much for my taste The salads are very good! Pizza is cheap but good. Used to order delivery from here constantly when we lived nearby. Prices are reasonable and the guys are usually really friendly. i will be a repeat customer of bellisario's ... hurray .   my new fave pizza joint in this area (outside of Fiori's)"  in desperate need of remodeling and is hit or miss when open .. They are closed sometimes at 9 pm on a Friday .. Very bizarre"  when we called we told the man over the phone that we lived off of Overbrook which was a mile away. He then proceeded to very rudely challenge that we lived that close because he had no idea where we were talking about. We then told him that from where he was located he simply had to turn left on 51 and then make the second right. He scoffed and said I'll be honest I have no idea where that is and we won't deliver there. Completely unprofessional and ridiculous. We will not go back or order." "We order pizza from here all the time and it is always great.  Consistent each order.  We just had a white pizza w tomatoes...it was exceptional.  Bubbly crust Parking can be a pain at night and on weekends - probably because there is likely to be a line for this place...  try for lunch or an early dinner."  NC over four years ago.  I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.  Charlotte really needs a place like this and the closest attempt is Brixx Pizza.  Been there a few times and the ingredients are not up to par with Il Pizzaiolo."  however I'd like more options than just italian wine.  We sampled a charcutterie platter which was amazing.  The meats were top notch and flavorful.  The hummus and olives were some of the best I've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. The best I've ever had.  After a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  Wow The only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom of the menu does say ""please no substitutions"" but they really mean it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes. So if you have kids or picky eaters with you They have the best tomato sauce ever!  The pizzas are to die for and the pastas are both creative and super fresh tasting while still being really yummy!  those make up for everything else.  the margherita DOC is a staple.  always a winner.  i'm also a big fan of the wine bar...with or without food.  always a good time."  but not close enough to feel like you're sitting on top of someone's lap.  The decor was also contemporary with a traditional flair.  What I didn't expect was the hostess informing me that I can wait at the wine bar if I'd like - what a welcome twist.  Out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone's kitchen  highly recommend eating in the ""wine bar"" out back - where the main restaurant is loud Probably one of the best places to eat pasta or wood-fired pizza... "This place has a very pleasant atmosphere - I sat outside on the patio and it was very enjoyable.  I've also heard the wine bar is nice and cozy.  Most importantly "We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago  the pizza I had here was an over priced soggy mess with a burnt crust. The oven was way too hot for this type of pizza."  is the whole city in a 1995 time warp?  (...Or are all of these places just cheating on their tax bills?  It's a lot harder to hide check and credit card transactions from an auditor.  With cash  and the fennel sausage and rapini pizza (I forget the menu name).  My favorite was the Bianca - the ricotta cheese pushed it over the top.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  We sat in the outdoor seating in the back In summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  I didn't find the inside half as exciting.  I'll give them another chance on the pizza  prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great  the prices are so high for the food that I have stopped going. $17 for a indiviudal pizza? The wine selection also has gone down in quality and up in price. If you have money to burn  I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified ""thanks a lot"" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal  one of the best I've ever had was the ""worst"" savory...that is saying something.  Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list when I travel."  but you can wait in the wine bar--if that's not also packed to the brim(which it usually is). The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust If your in the mood for pizza check this place out!  It was a bit pricey just for pizza  sitting outside is such a luxury.  Order the Rigatoni alla Siciliana.  Perfecto!" Service was fine for a crowded restaurant.  Was a little loud." "My local go-to for a great meal with friends. Always delish  and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more. (yes I know that reference is french) So mangia bene at Il Pizzaillo" There are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service Very quaint and cute inside. I went there Thursday and had to hold myself back from not going there again on Saturday.  My pasta loving self will sure to be back soon though!" Looking forward to next time and trying the tiramisu." Still one of my all time favorite places to eat!!! I now live in New York City and haven't found anything like Pizzaiolo. This place is a real treasure! The crust on the second pizza was still rubbery. The platter and wine were by far the best part of the meal. Overall the evening was enjoyable but I don't think I would order the pizza again." Great traditional pizzas - but don't complain that it isn't like Pizza Hut! The back room is amazing.... It makes me want to check Kayak for some cheap tickets to PIT!" It's been several years since my last disappointing visit here . I am glad things have improved . Great selection of food with many varieties of pizza . Nice wine list . The restaurant is separated between front restaurant portion and wine bar in rear . It is a pricey restaurant and all parking is on-street or in a public garage .  this place will get on your nerves. I got cut in line placing my name in for a table by some lady who felt entitled to cut in front of the several other ppl waiting bc she had a baby with her. Then I went to the back bar area where half the bar stool seating and the sofa sitting area was being taken up by children under 4 and baby carriages. Just beware of the self entitled yuppies that frequent this place and every nice restaurant on Washington Ave. the experience will lower your dining experience as it did mine!"  I really didn't pull up Yelp to rate this restaurant...I'm actually looking for a place to go eat since I'm still famished after ""eating"" here." full review with pictures on my site" So I'm having some Pizzaiolo Margherita DOC in about 2.5 hours. Can't wait!" I suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian. I'm sure there are better in the Pittsburgh area." Service is professional & prompt"  but really great pizza. Honestly it's the closest I've had to real Italian pizza outside Italy. The little wine bar out back is fun."  tried this place bc of Yelpers. Was not disappointed We parked on the street and were able to find a spot easily. Seemed like a pretty and safe neighborhood. When the weather is decent The best  margherita I have EVER had! Someone send me one to Chicago please!!!!  service..etc. Through the back door and up the stairs is the most awesome wine bar. Pizza is totally rad. Mix of attire so everyone can be fashionable.  Patio is great. Great date place. Bathroom is 5 star also ( yes I'm now rating bathrooms after a few bad Larry David like episodes)."  but it's Italian at its best. No Joke. It's rare to find a true D.O.C. certified pizza but they've taken all the steps to make it happen. Everything else I've tried on the well-rounded (but not too long) menu is terrific as well. Very focused wine list--all Italian and perfectly matched to the food. My only complaint is that the place is so popular now that it can be very crowded at peak hours and loud in the main room. I've never had to wait very long for a seat  even though we asked to split it between two.  I'm still waiting for my overpayment to be refunded by the restaurant..." This 5 star rating is absolutely for the best margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks Misty for the awesome rec!"  this is still the best.  Robertos is the only other brick oven that compared.  Now that Roberto is in the Village My only real complaint is the olive oil they serve with the bread.  It could use some flavor or seasonings or even just some parm and a little pepper.  The only bland item I tasted.   Also The location is super. The outdoor patio and wine bar are great. I think the pizza is not good due to the soggy crust. We have been their many times and every time I ask for crispy crust and get soggy.  and it was excellent with different kinds of imported stuff that I can't pronounce but I can assure you did not go to waste. I had a pasta special which was made with sausage ragu and was absolutely delicious. My wife had a chicken dish which was on the plain side We will never go back!!!" 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into." This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh. the BEST pasta vodka and margherita pizza in the universe! its worth the money and the extra calories! :) "I don't really know where to start...It was my best friends birthday...we were being spontaneous...the amazing staff there welcomed us after lunch...(open all day) and served us the most amazing Italian meal I've ever had! (Both Toni and I are Italian and are amazing cooks...so the compliment is not given lightly) We proceeded to order pizza  but we went up to the wine bar and the wait wasn't that bad.  Loved the wine bar in the back! Comfortable and trendy.  For dinner we started with the insalta caprese. Yum!  We then split a pizza and pasta dish. Both were fantastic. The waitress was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations.  Wine selection is good "Tucked in a corner table in their wine back house location was cozy given the rain pour happening outside. I ordered a chianti to start and then we ordered the vegetable app dish to share Authentic and very good. One of our favorite restaurants. Food is always just right and moderately priced. Love the prosciutto and arugula pie. Meat balls are great as an appetizer. Wedding soup is delicious. Gets very crowded on the weekends and the bar above the garage in back of the restaurant gets PACKED (like sardines in a can!) with people waiting to eat. Try them for lunch or during the week if you hate long waits on Friday and Saturday evening.  but it is the most authentic and that is why it is getting 5-stars.  I was craving and in search of a place where I could get the most authentic DOC style Italian pizza  a great restaurant and I cannot wait to come back try their DOC pizza- it looked superb." http:  simplyromanesco.blogspot.com 2012 02 leave-gun-take-cannoli.html"  up scale pizza. Not a good place for young kids. Lovely patio." The most delicious pizza and the best cocktails in the area!! Such friendly staff!! I've always had an amazing experience!! Best gnocchi since I was in Italy.  but I rounded up for this one"  the Napoli antipasto is awesome but our entree left much to be desired. I forget the exact name but it was basically a spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe they charge $16 for this dish! It was cold and not a good portion. I got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just not a good value for the $. I just moved back from nyc and my fav place there charges significantly less for significantly more. I'm so disappointed bc this was one of my go to places in Pgh! : " I've seen people complain that sometimes they have to wait to be seated  but was disappointed when it came out soggy.  Should have been nice and crisp.  There weren't even many toppings to make it soggy.  probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices."  cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar."  but they seated us in the table right next to the door where everyone waiting to be seated was standing right beside our table. Plus every time someone opened the door  service was good and perfectly timed. A bit on the pricy side  or you can also head down the street to one of the other bars on the street until they call you to tell you your table is ready. That usually makes the wait seem very reasonable. We happen to live within walking distance so we have frequented this restaurant probably more often than we should 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA  but these drinks are for sipping anyway. The bartender was sweet "Best margherita I've had since eating at El Presidente in Napoli  not the best and very small. The wine bar in the back has the best atmosphere. Our waiter was the best part "Great-tasting food accompanied by great service. The antipasto and pizza margherita were a little different than we're used to  I was very happy with my experience there."  and the next time I am back I think I'll try the pizza that they are so famous for.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you have not been there.."  I've been coming here for years now and was slightly annoyed that they have reduced the size of their pizzas.  We used to get 6 slices and now you get 4 "The enoteca in the back is my favorite place to grab a glass of wine with a friend while noshing on the antipasti plate. The staff is quite knowledgable about wines. It's cozy The food and ambiance at both their Mt. Lebanon and Market Square locations are above average.  The Mt. Lebanon location has a particularly nice  I miscalculated the size of baby + diaper bag and knocked over the glass of wine spilling it all over his yellow shirt. It almost looked like a tie dyed effect. The wait staff rushed to our side bringing him a glass of seltzer water and me a new glass of wine (I later found out at no charge). Seltzer water had nothing on the masterpeice I created. The shirt was officially retired. Once we got settled We are lucky enough to live within walking distance to il Pizzaiolo. Love the pizza and they have the best vodka sauce. We end up getting takeout a lot from here and it never disappoints!  a beverage ordered that never arrived.  No domestic wines so no cabernet or chardonnay on the menu; we don't make good wines in CA?  Other than that Mrs. Lincoln  I'm not sure I would come back due to the other factors."  and they could improve a bit on this." 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA I can only add to the already good reviews on Yelp. The outside area was very pleasant. The food was simply very good traditional italian. Highly recommended.  a major pizza fail. BUT! It's a great Pittsburgh effort and for that reason I give it three stars. The service is stellar  and I have no problem with it if the wine is not normally available. But I feel it should be a little cheaper when you can" From a Detroiter to you; I truly enjoyed my experience and my meal!" Hands down Best pizza in pittsburgh. It's a little pricey being $15 for a pie but so worth it.  which I absolutely recommend. While you're waiting check out the quaint wine bar in the back. Servers are knowledgeable and attentive. Overall a great place to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine."  and I also had their lasagne bolgnese and a fresh buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  All were amazing and on par with the quality I found in Italy.  They also had a nice selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US before.  I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  All the staff there is also very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere feels more like a gourmet brick oven pizza place than a nice Italian restaurant  there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children You can't wrong with any of the pizza choices here. Some of the best Italian and pizza in the city. Would also recommend the penne vodka for dinner and Sicilian sour to drink. Fantastic wine bar and patio.  and the penne alla vodka (except we substitute gnocchi for penne) every time we go. We've tried other combinations. But this one never disappoints and is plenty for two. The vodka sauce is the best I've had and the pizza - better than any I've had in Chicago  a decent meal.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  But we had nothing that we would make us want to go back." "I have tried II Pizzaiolo twice now and I am not a fan. The food was very good but over priced and the atmosphere is stuffy and very loud. If you are looking for a relaxing night out  I will certainly return to the wine bar for maybe a glass of wine and try maybe the pizza "Excellent Italian restaurant. We ate in the wine bar behind the actual restaurant which was very nice and cozy. We shared the sea bass and eggplant parmesan. Portions were generous and the food was excellent. The eggplant parmesean was the best I have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant The hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say...""who is this bi***?""  hahahaha.  VERY RUDE. VERY.   WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY.   Dishonorable staff.  Unimpressive food."  it is much more than that. Here is the magic words to unlock this experience -- Tell the hostess downstairs that you will wait for a table upstairs (you want to eat up there and you will be waiting there in the meantime) and to come find you up there when the table is ready The sad state this once cutting edge restaurant devolved into is a real shame as it used to be one of Pittsburgh's best."  wait times are bearable on weekends (the wine loft makes it easy to wait).  Fantastic food - top choices are the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer I've heard there can be a long wait but we went the saturday before Easter and had a party of 6 but didn't have much of a wait.  If you do have to wait The atmosphere in the wine bar is fabulous and the food is decent. I really like the pizza and marinated vegetables. The meatballs are also excellent. Sadly I cannot support a business that provides such poor service."  they give yiu a ""pizza knife"".  Trust me when I say it is barely better than a butter knife.  The server explained that the no longer cut their pizzas b c it makes the crust go soggy quicker if it is cut.  I'm sorry  authentic Italian. The best food I had in a long time. Plus Better deals and better food at a mall food court."  but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA The service and atmosphere were ideal as well. I will definitely be back!" Highly recommend this restaurant. We ate in the upstairs wine bar. But will definitely come back to sit in the beautiful courtyard garden!" "have gone here many times and always enjoy it. Great quality food  I suggested to a friend to meet for a late dinner. Just beforehand I Reviewed the menu on line and was shocked to find the price increase from 10 yrs prior when i visited as a a family often. $19.00 for gnocchi? Unbelievable! I suggested another place but my friend said to keep with the plan. We decided to split a pizza. Then found to our dissatisfaction that the pizza was only 10"". We ordered one each but again...$17 for a pizza? This was a place enjoyable and reasonable for A family of four. .no more. What was worse was the pizza was just average. I am in the food business and find it so dissapointing to to feel taken when all i wanted was a good meal for a fair price. Let's not go into the underfilled $10 glass of wine."  the pizza I chose for dinner was very unique - fried the finished in the fire oven. It was excellent. Loved the Italian craft beer as well! Will be back!" Come with friends and enjoy a great meal." Expensive but worth it! "Don't go in winter. Seriously.  It's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold. The food and wine are great Have been here multiple times over the past few years. Amazing food...great service and the wine annex is the bomb. Highly recommend and a great date spot or place to entertain people visiting from out of town! Excellent service!  Waitress is friendly and personable.  Clean and nice interior.  Pizza reminded me of authentic pizza from Italy.  Atmosphere is friendly and casual.  Kids will enjoy and adults too! If prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amount you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19 Very good Italian good. It was loud and busy on Saturday night. A little pricey but I don't mind paying extra for good food like this. Get the tiramisu (very large portion) or canoli for dessert both were very good. We were not disappointed with the main entrees or appetizers and the service was very professional.  it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal. Totally worth the price in my opinion!"  it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal. Totally worth the price in my opinion!"  pumped! .......Well ours was edible but no match. So with deflated egos back to il pizzaiolo we go. Empty pockets I have heard good things about the pasta - I will be back." Fantastic meal. The hot fresh bread is a must.  The meat balls are the best I ever had.  Everything is fresh.   I will return. I will speak up for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything is freshly made With all of the fabulous choices in the South Hills Then order whatever else you want because it's going to be amazing." Great place for a date night . Get a reservation- we were lucky we got a seat !"  better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh"  and good quality cheese to top it off. I was unaware until my most recent visit that they have a patio and wine bar in the back. The patio is a courtyard fantastic food and wine! Had the bolognese and some other chicken dish that was amazing!  it might not be everyone's favorite pizza but it's a certain type of preparation and you have to like it in order to like it....(if you understand what I mean). Their Margherita DOC pizza is bellisimo!  The wine room and the outdoor area are both wonderful places to enjoy a meal.  The main restaurant is also very nice but if you can get into the wine room or the patio--do it.  A little tip: they have a wonderful Falanghina (white Italian wine) that tastes amazing on the patio.  Their caprese is excellent and fresh and if they have the burrata appetizer---GET IT and you will be thrilled.  Their potato croquettes are also marvelous.  The wait staff is always very nice.  It's not your ordinary pizza joint so if that's what you are expecting....there's a few nice ones within walking distance!"  byob and reasonably priced. Food remains ok but prices have more than doubled. I don't return on principle. There is just as good I've been to this location many times. Always have a true authentic Italian meal. Tried the lasagne this time and the flavor explodes with every bite. Awesome restaurant. "Awesome beehive oven pizza "An hour and half later and we are still waiting on food.  Waitress hasn't checked on us in half an hour.  Would rate the food Not impressed with food or service! For the price of these meals I would expect excellent service! Waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a Wednesday at 5pm. Short answers and we had to drink our water sparingly because he wasn't refilling them! I ordered the Margherita pizza and it was mainly sauce. I wish I would have gone to bistro 19 or mineos!  but not offensive either.  The atmosphere and service definitely make this a great date night spot.  The wine bar in the back is fantastic." "The bar in the back is gorgeous. Drinks are better than their food. My pizza was okay "My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I still remember coming here as a little kid and getting a cream soda every time. The burrata is amazing and fresh Just not what I expected. Pizza was weak. Under baked.  Sauce was lacking.  Crust was way to soft.  And service could of been better. $500.00 bill says it all. Meatballs were good and warm bread was good. Light and crispy like the pizza crust SHOULD of been. Over priced for the quality.  Mediocre.  Slanted outside table made relaxing uncomfortable. One of the earliest places making Neopolitan pizza in Pittsburgh - and they've mostly remained consistent over the years (though the pizzas are a little smaller). The Margherita DOC is as good as what you get in Italy. The Sicilian eggplant pasta is excellent !! Big fan of both locations - Mt. Lebanon and Downtown Market Square.   Wish they'd invest in some noise dampening acoustic tiles and refresh the chairs.  But it's charming nevertheless. This was the first time I has been and I went to this restaurant and we went because of a recommendation. Absolutely spot on. I got the margarita pizza which was great except I could use more basil. My husband got the eggplant Parmesan which was by far the best of ever had. Even though we were full we tried two desserts that were apparently made fresh every day by the pastry chef. I got the term is Sue which was excellent except a bit too much Cocoa. He got the limoncello cake which was outstanding. Keep up the good work we'll be back! 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA I have been wanting to check out Il Pizzaiolo for a while now and glad we got the chance to on a random Monday night. The place is small inside and we lucked out just walking in but I would recommend trying to get reservations for a Friday or Saturday.  Our server was great and knew a ton about the entres and patiently explained each one to us.  They have a small draft selection so if you like wine this is the place to go. Being a beer drinker I went with a Hoegaarden.  While we waited for our entrees we were served 2 large pieces of cooked pizza dough that had salt and olive oil on them. I think they ran out of bread but this almost homemade breadstick was fantastic!  Our entrees arrived promptly and I went with the rigatoni which came with 3 meatballs. The sauce was a great combo of sweet savory and the meatballs were delicious.  My family member ordered one of the pizzas which came with arugula and prosciutto-it was enough for 2 meals and great to take home.  The prices are reasonable for a finer Italian restaurant.  Great place for date night.  ambiance is on point and the service is second to none. I highly recommend skipping the main dining area We spotted the table next to us eating dessert and couldn't resist ordering the Delizia al Limone "What a strange experience - I travel for business and walked in and asked to see the menu. The hostess wasn't very friendly & I tried to make light conversation about the weather... I'm in sales it always works. I thought she must not of heard me as she didn't respond? I then asked to be seated - the manager or owner no smile & without a word pointed to a table. I read through the menu  relaxed ambience at the wine bar. Exceptional service and the same for the meals."  I have been back to the Mt. Lebo original for a while now and it is still excellent. Everything from the espresso to the Pizza is infinitely better than downtown because Ron Molinaro has not deviated from his idea of offering food that is true to  Naples. His steadfast refusal to reduce quality for the sake of profit is what I respect about him. He maintains friendly and knowledgeable staff who know the food and the wine list. You cannot go wrong here and I will continue to support this place and any other that Mr. Molinaro opens." I would eat here again if the opportunity presented itself! I'm glad I got to enjoy a great meal with friends at a new place!" Came here for dinner when we first moved to Pittsburgh and we loved it. The food was super tasty and the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. I loved the huge stone pizza oven We will be back when we have more time to further explore the menu." 6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA  but it is pricey for what you get."  service and atmosphere! Romantic back patio! We thought we were in Italy."  we ordered arancini's and meatballs as appetizers. Both were delicious. Then after much consideration I ordered the ravioli caprese and they were awesome. Our waitress was lovely and very helpful as well. Great experience!" I personally would prefer this location to the downtown location  may have been more seating. Service was friendly enough This Pizza Hut is not a top choice It's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement." Came to pick up 12 pizzas for an event. Staff welcomed me and made small talk while we waited. Pizzas were hot and fresh and the place was immaculately clean. Good specials too. The time before last it was an hour wait and the guy talked to me on the phone like I was an idiot stating that the ""confirmation email"" time was ""different"" from theirs smh."  and the pizzas are usually late and cold. You can usually count on a full hour for delivery. I prefer Pizza Hut's food to Dominos or Papa John's but those other places run circles around this one for service and time. Would love to see these folks kick it into high gear because I'd eat there a lot if they would improve their delivery time." N.C my husband &I love it here......we have met some very nice people and some good friends.The southern hospitality here is great...and  food is also!We have tried many new dishes.We now have a New Home here ." But not anymore. I'm going back to dominos well or atleast till I get to a better Pizza hut. This one takes forever no matter if it's a slow day or pack day. They can never get the order right either. Sorry three tries is good enough. Wouldn't recommend this pizza hut to anyone unless if they like to wait......" "Service was horrible!!! The waiter was rude and gave us an attitude when we kindly asked for a refill and when she came with the water Pizza came warm not even hot steam from opening the box nothing. Crust was not seasoned. Ordered before 9. Came almost close to midnight. Smh. Considering it holiday weekend was told 1 hour  for delivery. but before midnight.. #no. pick up better then delivery. This is the best NY style pizza in the Charlotte region.  I've had NY style pizza from all over Charlotte and this is by far the best.  I just wished they delivered.  The staff is very friendly. sJtGRBWYUj013nkFA4Hrdg  it is a good value and the food is not bad." You can dine in or take out. A great place to call in and order za and subs and bring home to enjoy. Support your local business cause pizza hut and subway really don't need your $'s." OMG...  Am making myself hungry and its only time for breakfast.  Good thing we got some to-go last night so the fridge is full of leftovers!  Yes... The slices are good cold too :)" My favorite Pizza place in the area. A small here is like a large from other places. Wish they had the beef pepperoni like their Mooresville location.  the crust was my favorite although I didn't care for the toppings as much.  I am partial to Chicago style and the drinks are expensive so the rating is just a 3 star great pizza and huge portions this is some really good stuff. They are really friendly and this is a hell of a deal its the size of three slices at any chain and they taste amazing. The only thing that could be better are there sides but still this place is worth a shot for a pizza lover The food is amazing but the pizza isn't the only thing that's NY style. The staff's attitude is straight out of the big apple. We were told that we couldn't have our pie for dine-in bc they closed in 30 minutes. We didn't have a problem taking it to go. But I'd rather take a pass on the abrasively poor customer service. "This place is the best it gets in North Carolina.  Many pizza shops try to compare to that New York pizza style Pizza by the slice are VERY large. Great garlic knots! It's in the parking lot with food lion. Nice atmosphere inside and quick service. I will definitely be back. "Awesome pizza. A bit greasy The Stromboli is my favorite. The Calzones are very good also. The pizza is good. The Philly steak and cheese is not their best offering.  have been looking for a good pizza place for the past couple months.  finally found it :) the price is really good as well." Note: I always just get cheese pizza because the kids like it more Staff is extremely friendly and somehow always remember me which is odd since I don't make it up that way very often. I have driven all the way from SC a few times just to grab a few slices. Can't recommend them enough." Hands down the place to get pizza in the Charlotte  Huntersville area.  I actually have gotten to know Tony himself.  The pizza is a bit greasy but it's the kind of good greasy that makes you crave more. Warning: Everything here is HUGE. The calzones are bigger than my head. The stromboli could probably feed a small army. The pizza slices are as long as a newborn baby. There can be a bit of a wait sometimes  mister!  Better bring your appetite because they won't let you leave hungry.  Excellent sandwiches too.  Stromboli takes a while to bake Awesome food and friendly service. The people that work at Tony's are super nice and the pizza slices are huge!!! Definitely great bang for your buck. I always come to Tony's when I'm in Charlotte.  Brooklyn South is a close second.  I do wish they had real buffalo wings but I have never had a bad experience." "Great authentic NY style pizza. Call ahead or be prepared to wait as there is always a line. Interior could use some renovations Try the garlic knots....yum! New York Pizza just like when I lived in Queens!!! Don't forget to try the desserts they are great.  I just think the dough is dry like cardboard.  I enjoy the veal parm here.  The calzone and stromboli dough is like the pizza dough.  I like calzone and stromboli to have soft flaky dough  and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice The place looked clean. When I went it was crowded (Friday night) so it took a while for my pizza to be ready. The large pizza is huge bigger than the box and tasty. My hubby asked me if I got an extra large pizza lol. The slices are huge. One slice is like 2. I also ordered a salad and wings. The wings were good a little spicy. I didn't eat the salad yet because I ate everything else first. I would definitely go back and try other things. "This place is phenomenal.  Just grading the pizza and service here.  The large pizza is huge.  As others have noted "Not the best pizza I have had but certainly not the worst. We got a medium and couldn't eat half. (2 people). Seemed a little pricey for nothing special. $35 for a medium pizza (3 toppings) a chef salad and 2 fountain drinks. Now it is hand tossed and fresh The bread the meals come with is just a warmed tough roll.   They should start giving the option of garlic knots instead of French bread loaf." Pizza is good. Meatballs seem store bought. I wasn't impressed. Maybe because in not a newyorker. Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a slice. Order delivery from elsewhere... Really it's not that great "Had a meatball sub for lunch today.  Very tasty.  But SCREAMING hot.  Burned my mouth on the first bite.  So be careful!  Otherwise a good  great tasting crust. One of the best slices of pizza in Charlotte." "Great pizza at a reasonable price. Picked up take out pepperoni and cheese. Only down side to picking up the pizza was that there was not a separate line for pick up and people ordering slices pies in the restaurant. However  Domino's weak. And they used canned mushrooms. You can tell because when they use real mushrooms they shrivel up a bit in the heat. These were still slightly slimy and that color that canned mushrooms have. My fried ravioli was way too chewy and the breading was bland." "The pizza is the best in Charlotte IMHO.   Service is always fast and pleasant.  It can get very crowded with takeout customers on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons.  The pizza is terrific NY style thin crust and very large pies.   The subs are also very good as are the salads.  The hot entrees are very generous and tasty  as it only takes one to fill me up.  And their garlic knots are quite scrumptious - so plan on getting a couple orders if you're a carb addict like myself!"  but that's what I expect and it's nothing a few napkins can't take care of. So happy to have tried Tony's!" Amazing pizza!  I'm so impressed after only the first time eating here.  Ordered a medium white pizza and it was ready in 15 minutes.  It was so delicious with fresh ingredients.  I'll definitely be back!  when I moved here I was happy to find Tonys. But last few times I have gone it has not taste the same. Crust not cooked enough etc I hope this is not a trend."  Lake Norman area. The others try but come up short."  it reminds me of the pizza slices in Washington Best pizza in Charlotte. Huge slices with excellent crust. The subs are excellent as well. I have been here over 20 times and have never had a bad experience. This is the best location of all the Tony's in the Charlotte area. Really enjoy this pizza parlor always seems to make it fit with which ever holiday it is. And the pizza is great.  great price! I've heard people talk of it for 20 (?) years and wish I had come sooner. Great food!" We will call to order a pizza to take home next time because we loved it!" Talk about a large pizza pie. The pizza overlaps to the edge of the box like it busting in the seams. Gotta love the crust! Thin pizza with gooey cheese of course don't forget the toppings- sausage on one half of the pie and spinach on the other half. Now "Calzones are excellent!! Pizza is really good too. If you come on Friday or Saturday night expect to wait a little bit "I recently moved from NYC to Charlotte for work. This is Tonys pizza is the best place to go when we are craving really good NY pizza. They also have amazing sandwiches.  The workers are very friendly. Cleab environment to eat in and it's good for lunch or dinner.  you will be waiting in a disorganized line for at least 30 minutes. Very friendly service and good pizza "To categorize Tony's as ""your average pizza joint"" is by far one of the biggest mistakes one can make. Growing up on this pizza since elementary school "My go-to spot for a Philly Cheesesteak! Call it in to get it faster "I guess I will have to give it another chance but pizza and knots were dry .. hopefully it will grow on me it's next door .. have had better in Charlotte Great NY style pizza. Huge slices and friendly staff. The best pizza you can get in the area. Ok pizza..... nothing great. If you transplanted this place and put it in NY then it wouldnt stay open too long. The slices are quite large but the Ny style just isnt there. The closest pizza i have found to back home is Due Amichis. Been eating the pizza here for years! Still our favorite. The large is huge with big ol' floppy slices. Love this place. Some of the best pizza you can get in clt that reminds me of up north. Always got it as take out for a stay in movie night when I lived on this side of town. Tasted so wonderful but I find it a little ridiculous I just paid $11 for a Philly steak and French fries. I'll return again but only if I'm in the area and not trying to budget myself for lunch "Man! I was really looking forward to a nice pizza! But the slices are so much different tasting then when you order an actual size pizza. It was so dry and had no flavor whatsoever  and worth the price. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that we ate there There was a group of teenagers and moms in there and they seemed to also be enjoying their meal.  The restaurant is decorated in early modern tacky which is pretty cool.  This is not a fancy date night place by any means but is a great lunch pizza place."  and this is like getting a slice of pizza back home. BUT Everything is good- if you're a wing person you must try the wings with a side of marinara or blue cheese. Spaghetti Best pizza around!  Eggplant parm is also very good. When you talk to the staff you can tell this is a real Italian place!  and wait in line for another 30 minutes trying to get my food. They really need to come up with a system to get food out quicker. The same person takes all orders  which is a good indication that the food is good. New York style pizza that you have to food to eat. In the New York tradition  this place gets all the ingredients just right The largest table seats 6 people and there are no chairs that aren't affixed to the ground to add to your table.  We had to sit in two of the large booths that back up to one another.  This restaurant would greatly benefit from expanding their space.  There were not enough tables for everyone waiting for food.  There also isn't really a waiting area Now I remember why I rarely get pizza here - they are super expensive! The pizza is very good however! Authentic NY style (as authentic as you can be in NC). The toppings were $2 each. I didn't realize how expensive it was until I went to pick up 3 large pizzas with 2 toppings each - $64!!! The pizza was good tho! "The best pizza around! New York style pizza and subs are my two favorite things! The people that work there are incredibly kind too. Everything is on point: the staff "It's pretty ridiculous when you order a pizza and it takes an hour to show up. And it is pretty rude when you call and ask about your order and the employee just responds with ""They are already on their way."" and guess what The worst Pizza Hut ever. Stayed on hold for 10 mins trying to change an order. The manager Tiffany says it's not her problem their website had issues and because I called in and my order was wrong I had to wait 2.5hours to get my pizza when at first it was just an hour. Customer service is awful I won't be eating here ever again! There are plenty of pizza places in the area. Do not go to this one."  why are you accepting delivery orders at all? So many questions left unanswered along with so many mouths unfed. This type of service is just completely unacceptable. At this point I'm not even certain that a delivery will happen at all.   Needless to say I will be making sure to inform everyone around me of the plight I've endured through Pizza Hut from here on out anytime ordering a pizza is discussed." Wrong pizza was delivered. Contacted the manager who promptly hung up on me. Continued calling until I was able to talk with him. Very rude. Needs to have training on how to deal with customers!  when the manager ( i believe his name was Chris) answered and i explained my situation and he put me on hold again. Angie then got on the phone to tell me her manager needed me to call at another time because they were too busy. This location has the worst service."  I can't wait to get to Yelp." "Pros: service has always been cool with us and they're really nice to kids. The flavored lemonades never stop flowing but it's $2 for stuffed crust Usaully good service but tonight they burnt all the pizza .....then gave a half done pizza ....then ran out of thin crust ! Too much drama in one night....left my family hungry and waiting 1.5 hours for pizza.....really they didn't even comp the meal but rather gave a discount off the next pizza.......not sure if I'll ever be back!  breadsticks and desert. Received a phone call if I still wanted my order then arrived cold without any plasticware. Terrible."  food is lousy even for a chain restaurant. Too many decent pizza places in Charlotte to settle for this place."  and not exactly what  I had ordered ! Ate it anyway - nothing else open and no transportation....Got sick as hell a few hours later in the middle of the night!  Don't patronize this place...You've been warned!"  if not more . They need new phones because the person taking the order either was deaf or seriously couldn't hear. I get there and the place is CHAOTIC. I couldn't even hear myself think. Not to mention my bread sticks were hard almost like brick and tasted like card board. Very disappointing! Lastly The pizza was good however the service was less than to be desired. I originally ordered over the phone the delivery time was 50 mins. I called right back and said ill pick it up. When I arrived the person that took my order Acoya did not change it to carry out. I ask did he correct my pricing to the $10 carryout price. Instead of fixing the price being lazy he offered me a soda that I did not want or ask for. Its called customer service ..... definition showing you value your customers. Service sucked!!!!!  We were in there for lunch and there were two other tables with folks eating. we sat there for 20min. with no interaction with the pizza hut staff.  So we got up and left.  don't think I'll be back to that pizza hut." "On two different occasions in the past three I have attempted to have a pizza delivered and have been told that ""we are not taking any more delivery orders to night. Both time I called before 10:30pm. The last time I finally got pizza delivered it took over 2.5 hours. The only explanation is piss poor management." "Service! Sucks....they where not able to deliver a pizza for 2  I think she said her name was ""nari"" pronounced Na-r-eye. She deliberately hung up on me again when I asked if they deliver to the Econo lodge."  it was almost doughy it was so undercooked! It's incredible to me that a place can have so many complaints and Pizza Hut still allows them them to operate and give their brand a horrible name! If I ever order Pizza Hut again "Every employee that works at this Pizza Hut needs to be fired. They give you long quote times to keep you from ordering (2 hours!) and then keep you waiting longer than that (I waited 4 hours!!) I never got my pizza because they lied and said they came and called me 3 times so they left. I went up to the store to get my pizza and they screamed at me saying that I was trespassing and that they would call the police!!! What?! They never made my pizza Almost 2 hours to get a pizza delivered. They couldn't find the driver. They argued and argued and refused to take responsibility for this. Horrible horrible service on the phone. Terrible customer service. The food here is fabulous and the interior is quite cute. On top of all that  the rudest people ever.  Made me say hmm I don't think I want to go back if I'm visiting my grandma on the weekend again.  But I shouldn't let butt holes ruin my time with Beauregard's.  I just wish they could better plan this event  place seems kind of dirty. Wouldn't recommend."  as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on. I would not pay full price  I'm going back tomorrow! I will do my best to check in with my bojankety cell phone service I'm sure I will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently. But from a food standpoint Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  We ordered ribs and steak.  The only side dish I didn't like were the mixed vegetables.  my dish was as flavorless as possible and rather oily. I had a container of rice and very sparse pieces of not marinated pork tenderloin. I'm not a hard cookie to sell  the steak was super tough and was reminiscent of those frozen steaks in a box the one could get at Walmart. Not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill."  took 20 to see a sever and another 45 to see food"  buffalo chicken sandwich and their wings. All those items are under 10.00. Tuesday drafts are 2.00. I would like to see an expanded beer selection but that is my only complaint. It is a 'Dallas Cowboys' bar so I would not recommend days when they play. Go Panthers!!!" Needless to say this was not my favorite!"  it keep ls the doors open and to be honest I'm very happy with the food and service....I live the wings and things so keep doing well and great job" "I've eaten at this restaurant twice. The first time I had the prime rib and it was great. Second time I had the lemon pepper wings and they were great. I haven't actually sat in and had dinner Terrible customer service.  Was told it would be 4 hours for a delivery.  Call Marcos pizza best customer service in town and fastest delivery anywhere "Took 3 hours for one pizza to be delivered. I have never in my life waited that long for any food to be delivered. Also It's not the mistakes that they make over and over but how rudely they address me and other customers.  There's a Domino's directly across the street that I go to  and hats off to the cook!!  The bread sticks were fresh and hot We had a decent dinner from there last night but it was greasy and we ordered a full order of regular breadsticks and got half cinnamon jr8D3lu1S0-eRpIVxkKnMA This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money. This place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else. delivery took almost two hours and pizza was cold. Not to mention my order was wrong. I used to work here many years ago i hate to see this franchise go down the toilet. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!! Will never order from there again and suggest you use caution as well  then an hour later they said it was going to take an additional hour.  Ruined our panthers football game!!  Never ordering from pizza hut again." "I'll keep it simple. Didn't expect much from Pizza Hut. We order from here fairly regularly since it's close to the apartment. Three of five times we have ordered recently have resulted in phone calls stating they are out of what we ordered. How exactly does a pizza joint *run out* of pizza?!?! This wasn't on a holiday or near closing..and it's happened three separate times. Don't waste your time here  I did not get a single apology or any sort of empathy.  At least I would think they would offer a simple ""I'm sorry for your wait.""  To top it all off I can't rate it at zero stars ... They delivered the pizza after 1.5 hrs... And they delivered it with wrong ingredients... "Wish I could give this negative 5 stars. Online ordered to carry out. Went to pick up and there were about 5 people in front of me waiting to pick up. Paid for my order and proceeded to wait another 20 min on top of the 15 since I had placed the order. The girl disappeared and no worker came out for about 10 min. The 'manager' finally came out after customers started requesting refunds. One by one they slowly got their orders or refunds. The manager I should have stayed home and made pizza myself. Would have been faster. Online order for pickup said the pizza would be ready at 8:06PM - it is now 8:45PM. It is total chaos and there are 10 other people standing around while the employees hide in the back so they don't have to admit to customers the pizza is late. Once I hailed them down they said 13 minutes. It has been 20. I'm not optimistic this pizza ever shows up. Bad service. Ordered online. Pizza not ready when promised. Staff has a bad attitude towards costumers. They are ALWAYS out of personal pans. Always. The last time I tried to figure out a solution for this issue they hung up on me. Lol. I was just trying to help because clearly no one else is...  tonight I waited over and hour and 15 minutes before I called them. The person that answered says my order will be delivered as soon as the driver gets back!! Why in the world wouldn't someone call me and tell me so I could make other arrangements?! I'm so tired of this pizza hut I just can't say enough bad things about it. It's a travesty that it's still in business. Tonight I cancelled my order - got dressed - went out and picked up food even though I don't feel well. This location is the worst and has been for years." Sigh... never ordering from them again." Delivery time right on schedule.  Pizza good fresh and hot.  Wrong drink but still good!  Would order again!  thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by." Its fast food pizza not a lot of expectations. We got our food delivered. We even got someone elses pizza. These guys has the seeds to call and leave a message to call back. If it was about the pizza you weren't getting it back. No way do you take a pizza from one house to another because you messed up. Hopefully the other guy got his free. We didn't need the extra pizza so we gave it to a homeless guy. So meh I've experienced better. Its called non chain pizza places that you pay an extra couple bucks for and get quality not tomato paste on cardboard. Our last order we used the ever-helpful Pizza Hut app and used one of the deals to try to get the best price for our two pizzas & two sodas. Luckily for us It's a Pizza Hut. Small. Very old and very run down. Take out only. Staff friendly and all but the place looks dirty.  interrupting me constantly while insinuating I was to dumb to know what a cheese pizza should look like. Also indirectly accused me of trying to scam her for a free pizza and told me if I didn't like it to bring the one I had back to the store and that I could have another. I will never order from here again." I would say avoid this place."  but I don't know that it's worth the money.  I can tell you that based on my the pizza I ate  willing to work within my budget on catering events.  The buffet is very good with a nice selection of pizza and a nicely filled salad bar with a couple of pastas at the end.  But don't stop there!  Order a sub or entree off the menu.  I have had the meatball sub Had the buffet. Not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight. Overall - just ok pizza. Air conditioning must not have been working either. This place was taken over and remodeled recently(within the last 4 months). The new owners seem to get it. This place is great for the value. I would ignore any posts older than 4 months or so since it is not the same place.  warm and friendly service. Wonderful family restaurant where you can bring the kids for great pizza. Calzones are great. Try the pizza buffet "Ginny may possibly be the best cook around! Village Pizza really is Italian food at it's best! Ordering from the menu or getting the pizza salad bar  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of their plate! I particularly loved the seasoning on their giant meatballs So glad this place has reopened with the original owners! Mangia!"  then one of the original owners re-opened it.  The pizza now is just ok.  I have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok." Great place to take anyone especially kids um and also delivery is incredible highly recommended So glad the old owners took it back over. SO MUCH BETTER. One of the better pizza buffets around town!!!  friendly and the local competition is slim.  I will probably take out from here again out of convenience but most of the time I will venture out of Fort Mill to get the good stuff." Decided on takeout last night - lasagna and chicken parm sandwich. Both were outstanding!!! This is more than a pizza place so don't forget to try other things than the buffet - you won't be disappointed. "I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of ""Real Italian Food"" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately Only gave 3 stars for how awesome they are."  the village I ate has returned. The buffet is good. But buffet is buffet. Order a pie and you can have some flavor. The lasagna is tasty. The atmosphere is a family restaurant. If you've been around Tega cay or fort mill sc you can remember when it was one of two choices. Good pizza is finally back just wish they were open Sundays. Need some za for watching football." "Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza  the buffet is always full with many different choices that look and taste wonderful. The staff is always very helpful and so nice. They offer a full menu as well as a buffet. The calzones are amazing. I'm not sure how anyone can complain about anything from here as I have always had a great experience."  especially the buffalo chicken pizza. My toddler enjoyed the spaghetti and I think this will become one of our regular go-to spots."  it's at the top of my list for places to visit. I LOVE their pizza- the Red Veggie is my favorite. They definitely have the best sauce in the Fort Mill Steele Creek area. I have tried almost everything on their menu and it is ALL delicious!  My favorite dishes are: the Stromboli  the pizza is top notch and delivery is fast. The spaghetti with meatballs are the best around. Also this is a great place to take the kids and the wait staff is friendly"  the new restaurant doesn't quite measure up like I remember from a few years ago. The Pizza was a little tough and chewey  wife and I both agree it's the best pizza we've ever had!"  great food and fun atmosphere."  and it's all you can eat. They have a variety to choose from and a salad bar. Yum yum yum !!" Went here for lunch with my son and had pizza buffet. Great service. Great buffet. Great price and clean. Highly recommend and will definitely return. Had their Deluxe Pizza and Lasagne dinner for carry out. Both were excellent. I will be eating here again. We we received a delivery (ordered by friends) from here after our second child was born. Can't believe we've lived around the corner from this place for 3 years and didn't know about it. Food was excellent! We had the chicken and eggplant parmigiana and couple of side salads. Highly recommend! Can't wait to order from here again!  best delivery pizza in my area.  Really nice people as well.  You should check them out." Love Village. It's quick & not cheap pizza. Ginny is amazing & accessible! You will not be disappointed in the buffet. jqSH8cUTY0hgJlDi8S01kA  Friendly People and Tasty Food! Can't get any better. Definitely the best place in the area to get a calzone." Great place for the quick and easy pizza joint. Everyone is super nice too. Definitely recommended!  pasta buffet. Had been there for the lunch buffet with colleagues and we had a good time. The lunch buffet has enough options for a mere $7.5. The veggie pizza and Cinnamon rolls r the best!"  and jalapeos. The ingredients were spot on! The cheese was different than what I've had in other calzone. Too bad I'm on diet now What disappointed me the most though was that the only dessert offered was a cinnamon glaze over warm thin slices of bread."  the ladies were extremely nice and helpful when I walked in the first time. Great food for an even better price!! I will definitely come back!" I'm still searching for a good..really good (ok great) pizza in the Ft Mill  Tega Cay SC  area. I decided to try Village Pizza and after trying their Supreme Pizza....I'm still searching. It is a pizza and it is ok....but it's not great. The sauce is the culprit. Too sweet. I can see this being a good place.for families with children or those looking for an average pizza experience. "Great quick stop for good food. Kids are from the buffet for 3.50 each. One adult Stromboli and 1 calzone. Hit the spot. Friendly My husband and I go here alot. The owner is there most of the time and she's great. The food is wonderful every time.  hot fresh food at a reasonable price and friendly staff." So I'm going with a 5 for this review because if I was a mom with teen boys who wanted pizza for lunch "Just what you expect from Pizza Hut - no suck. Same pizza you had before. Makin' it great. Embrace the noid. Tell papa John to suck shit through fresh ingredients. It's like McDonalds Super Bowl + snow storm I thought I would have to wait forever for delivery. The website said 70 minutes. I received my order in 30. I love the new choices for crusts! I got the hand tossed crushed red pepper crust and pepperoni and jalapeos for toppings. Yumm!   so I get take out and literally walk down to pick it up.  I order from there multiple times per month cuz my kids love it. This location has always delivered good pizza "Seriously the worst pizza hut I've ever ordered from. Granted we rarely order pizza so I've had limited experience with them but the past couple of times have been so bad. They take FOREVER to deliver. It shouldn't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza. The last time we ordered they actually called us to say that something happened with their computers and our pizza was never started then when the pizza came (way over an hour after we initially ordered) it wasn't even fully cooked  and tasty. I think there's only been one time that I was disappointed with the consistency of the dough "Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery..They were out of pizza  it's not even funny.  I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's  there is pretty much no reason to eat at pizza hut  average per usual. And why three stars?  The staff is always friendly and I appreciate it."  overcharged for same thing and didn't even get the waffle fries.  This fourth time is the last time.  The person I spoke to had no clue what I was talking about and had to ask every time I asked her a question  and was told they would remake them and send them out again but it would be another hour...so I have to wait two and a half hours or more to eat dinner.  After we received the remade ones Pizza Hut? You're fine if I'm broke or drunk. You're Kegger Greg. You're a fine once in a while situation that I would never dream of associating myself with in public. You're kind of a disaster sometimes It's Pizza Hut. So I give it a 4 for consistency and options (we like the crust option)s. We eat pizza once a week and Pizza hut is one place that everyone will eat.  a popular Valentine's Day destination.  One of our favorite places in Champaign.  I love the chicken capperi - the wine sauce is incredibly delicious.  Nice service.  Save room for dessert."  food's good.  Everything's good.  But nothing's great.  It's a great choice when you're in the mood for well-priced italian  mediocre Americanized red-sauce Italian but if you are like me  1 star for the prices that make a step towards redeeming it." ygZ1n-RjzZibC80NLgHauw Food was overpriced and not that great. Slow service wouldn't even refill my drink. Interior is dingy and the tables were sticky I would not recommend this place.  Manzella's is the place to go. The portions are big but are slightly pricey. They have a small menu but their speciality is a ""make your own"" past dish. They also have a handful of baked pastas which I found to be good as well."  dining room. Place has been around a very long time so don't expect it to be have an updated and elegant look. Always nice friendly service. Love the ranch salad dressing! Everything on the menu is yummy.  My boyfriend loves the Italian Beef sandwich and it comes with a large basket of warm crinkle cut fries that I help myself to.  I usually get the cheese filled ravioli and they are superb! Bread served with oil and parmesan cheese. They have a large dining room to the side for very large parties and celebrations. I have never had a bad meal or experience here. My boyfriend and I love it."  we always order delivery from here and it's consistently good. The pasta is pretty well made and the sauces are simple "Went here with my girlfriend. We both agreed it was good not great. Food is about what you'd expect from a central Illinois Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit dark and dated  but the service was sub par. Then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent. It's a pity too Amazing lasagna with terrific atmosphere.  this place still has a special place in my heart.  Years of coming here as a kid and with family makes this worth the nostalgic visit every once is a while when I come back to visit the family.  Though I wish Dom's was still open..." Get the Italian beef sandwiches This place is ahh mazing!! The boy Eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute. He washes the dishes but told me that he doesn't wash his hands so.. Only four stars. Had lunch there on a rainy day. The light was dark so I did not enjoy eating there. The food was just so-so. No much choice on the menu. Don't know if they had another menu for dinner. "Restaurant hasn't changed in more than thirty years and is very dated. The food is generally good  they could up the quality and cut on the portions and make it a trade off monetarily.  All in all I don't know what we will ever go back. I really want to like this place and I would REALLY like to support a local town staple but I'm not going to pay good money for that. Sometimes it's good to reinvent oneself and their quality and menu could use a big makeover. I am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return." "I am glad to know that one of the old Italian Restaurants from my youth still exists in Champaign. With Dom's gone and Mennechi's under new ownership  food anymore.  Everything on the menu is delicious and the service is usually very good.  My favorites are the Pizza  Manzella's could give a hot damn that you chose their establishment to celebrate your birthday in-no free cake (or even an extra package of saltines or a refill of that water you had to ask for!) So then the bill comes. My daughter-in-law had asked for Alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish. By this point Wonderful Italian beef sandwich. Loved the minestrone soup. Friendly atmosphere and waitresses was cute as a button. It's just rather depressing that there's really no good place to get a decent slice in downtown Phoenix." "pizza is good and you can get 2 big slices with the lunch special "European soups made from scratch.  Their specials change daily which keeps me coming back.  Their prices are bargin for the fresh food you get.  Variety:  pizza Met the owner (Horatio). He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned." Some of the best pizza in town. Fresh ingredients in both the pizza and the pasta.  I've tried different menu items and you can't go wrong with anything you order. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  Fast service and friendly staff.  the crust thick the sauce and toppings are (good) average.  On both occasions I took a piece of pizza home for later.  There are more options on the menu and offer more than one special for lunch usually.  Even when super busy during the lunch hour I have found the service to be quick and friendly." Perhaps it's time for the younger gentleman to take over management of this restaurant." Great family business.  I've been coming for lunch for a year now.  They have fresh soups and specials that change daily...the variety and price keeps me coming back! Papa Christo's opens at 7am for breakfast but closes at 3 in the afternoon  and are only open Monday through Friday."  you can go here and have a tasty lunch.  A neat place."  Philly cheese steak and other random food items." "Nice ma and pa pizza joint "For $6 after tax I got a medium drink and 2 huge slices of fresh pizza and this has to be one of the best slices of cheese pizza I've ever eaten! You can taste the herbs I too got the 2 slice and a drink deal.  I had the pineapple and ham pizza slices.  The sauce had a nice tang to it and I got ham and pineapple in every bite.  A good lunch deal. If2DUhmWIvlu2JFc_rR-Bw Okay this place is a solid joint for a quick downtown lunch that won't cost you much. The pizza looks wonderful from the windows... I suspect they get a lot of customers who are walking by with the beautiful looking pizza. Sadly I can say that while the pizza isn't horrible it's not as good as it looks. It's alright pizza... and sometimes you are alright with alright pizza. They had a lot of other menu choices so when I have a chance I'll check them out. They also have a pretty good deal for a downtown place 2 slices and drink for $6 even which if you know anything about downtown is hard to beat. The staff was friendly as well. So I'll be going back in the future. If2DUhmWIvlu2JFc_rR-Bw  really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!"  pasta and salad was so so but the pizza was tasty. Friendly On rare occasions the owners are rude. But that's rare so maybe they were having a bad day."  they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try." Get your own eye opener!"  it is thick and doughy. But if you like double dough or double crust The service is always great I go once every week or so."  the pizza is giant puffy slices. I'm not a huge fan of this style of pizza Good soups. They have stuffed peppers on Thursdays. One of my favorite downtown lunches. Good place to grab a quick bite if you're Downtown Phoenix and want to have some yummy pizza." This pizza place is very affordable and convenient.. Two deep dish slices and a drink for 5.99! The people at Papa Christo's are so nice I had to give them 4 stars. They are so warm and endearing you feel like you walked into your mother's kitchen. I ordered the pizza special: Any 2 slices with a free medium drink for $5.99. GREAT deal. The pizza slices are thick and both were yummy today - I even ate the crust! I would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service "I like pizza. I don't eat it often though. I like to get away from the chain food producers in many cases and find independent local businesses for pizza generally no matter where ever I live. However no one does a Pan Pizza like Pizza Hut! So I often crave the Pan Pizza crust Supreme Pizza and when I go for one or have one delivered will give you the shits.  other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get "" medium bone out ""? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake  they must all be horrible.  I hope someone reads this review and pays a few dollars more  now there never has to be a question  as to whether we should try it out or not."  and helpful in their explanations. Disclaimer: I have tried about four variations of three basic pizzas. I have enjoyed them all. I cannot speak for other items offered by Pizza Hut Don't order your pizza from this joint!! Manager is totally incompetent and has no idea how to use a computer!! This place is great for eatin' cheap and a tasty slice of pizza."  if you're reading this: You're way better than pizza. Honestly  come for lunch.  I'm always a fan of pizza by the slice places  and melty cheese....  YUM!  Not like NY pie I'm sure I'll be back for a cheap quick lunch."  a good place to stop in for a quick slice for lunch." I LOVE this place! You can keep your corporate cookie cutter sub shops. Give me one that is family owned and recognize you when you come in!  crispy with some old fashioned over burns like I want it. It's clean and the clientele were all normal people just like me. The owner seemed to know people by name and by eating here I'm supporting the local economy and a small family owned business. Very affordable combos starting at around $5." This place has yummy pizza and salads! Haven't tried the subs but they look delish! You will not be disappointed :) Cheesy hot pizza by the slice made just for you! Friendly staff :) And yes . . . This place is definately on my return list." Sweetest counter owners/ladies. Best pizza. Fast friendly service. Just a little hole in the wall sort of place. Awesome food. Great cheap slices of pizza and subs. Not too greasy and a chewy crust.  it's certainly better than any pizza chain. And the service is always friendly! It's obvious that Phoenix House has been around for a reason. Even more impressive when you consider they are only open Monday though Friday from 10-4."  with TVs playing sports situated around the room. This is a good place to go for a pizza party with your baseball team. I ended up getting a large Pepperoni with black olives It is a fairly large restaurant.  The serving staff are all quite young.   They have always been friendly and attentive since the first time I went there. Their food is pretty good and plenty of it for reasonable prices. It is a larger restaurant than you'd expect.  Maybe that is why we went there and were seated right away there on a Friday night after finding a forty five minute wait at five other places.  It may not be a gourmet place but I can't complain.  It fills me up. Their pizza is good if you heat it up the next day.  it has an upbeat atmosphere and I have never had to wait for a table at this location.."  and minestrone soup. We were very happy with the delivery time and food. Would buy from again!" That is why they will be around long after the trendy PIzza places that surround them go out of business." This place is close to work and I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon." JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A  the last time I had it was over xmas break and it was still bangin so keep it up table near the corner.  Give it a try."  SONY is the place to go when I'm in Phoenix. Each friend or family member I've taken there falls in love with the pizza. I've been to just about every location  and it's obvious someone cares about how the product tastes. If the owner reads this- thumbs up.)" Be sure to look in those cheesy coupon packets that come in the mail - Streets of NY typically has good coupons which help. They're a tad expensive but so worth it. I think the 18"" Hawaiian (don't judge us) is $23." "I come to phoenix for business every three months and I have to say that I really do look forward to eating here. Sometimes i may order out or dine in Check out my gluten free blog too: www.GlutenFreeAZ.com" Seriously? Shut up. This place blows. Wouldn't last 4 minutes in NY. I'll bet the Vegas store doesn't last either.  This place insults the pizza. Last visit was over a year ago and I said I wouldnt go back.  Stopped in Friday as a last resort and was pleasantly surprised.  We just had a regular pepperoni pizza and some wings.  They must have changed something with their pizza because I don't remember it tasting that good.  The wings were excellent and perfectly cooked.  Also you can't beat a 25oz Blue Moon for $5.50.  we'll be back. The pizza was good the wings were not so great overall it was ok... JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A Highly Recommend this location to anyone!"  it had a lot of flavor and was rich.  My bf had their meatball sub which again was a huge portion and he liked it a lot.  Next time we come back we will have to try their pizza!  Great job and keeping up with the times Streets of NY!"  pizza was just ok. The manager stood next to the bar the entire time playing on his phone. I never plan to visit this location again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"  and really enjoyed it.  My friend had the Chicken Parm sandwich; she is from Long Island; and really loved the sandwich...My other friend tried the fried chicken; ""Broaster Chicken""; it was extremely good - I have a new fried chicken take out place."  no reason for praise or punishment for anything Streets of New York does. But that chicken? Worth it."  obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later. With the wings and ravioli included! We wont be going back...to any of this chain and I dont recommend it. If you want a NY slice and some yummy wings go to pats pizza plus. Its a dive half the price and twice as good." Seriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself" I've yet to have anything at this place I'd consider sub-par or average. Not to mention the fact that the atmosphere is very soothing and quiet every time we've went." I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots This is a no-nonsense pizza delivery place.  Always relable and always good. I probably would have been better off waiting until Tuesday to visit Spinato's (which TRULY is good pizza) or went to the Groceries and bought a Digiorno pizza." It was my last evening in Phoenix on business and I just wanted to relax.  ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived hot and it was very good.  Would recommend you try!  will be an option for days when I just don't feel like cooking or leaving the house." My name is Matthew and i Ordered 2 cheese pizzas w/extra sauce. Was excited I received an email couponcoupon for a $10 pizza. Went to pick it up on way from work...and after I had a discussion with some of the employees about the coupon and number of pizzas I was  allowed by the manager James to have it honored. The staff before him said I could only have one pizza. So James settles it which was cool of him. Then I get home find out I have 2 pizzas w/o pizza sauce and only cheese. So I guess the lady that took down my order over the phone was confused. Why would anyone want only xtra cheese and  no pizza sauce?So I call James back to let him know what happen and he agreed to credit my ATM card. So least to say dinner was ruined for my kids/family. Now we are off to my son's baseball game starving. I now will wait patiently for my refund to post on my bank account. Oh what fun! They just lost my business. NOT COOL!"  I ordered directly from the STNY website & clearly ordered delivery. You need to have a qualified programmer re-evaluate your online ordering system. For now About 7 years of service for me." JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A Best pizza in down town!  but dry and a bit crumbly (not sure why so many pizza places in AZ have this 'problem' - especially when claiming to be ""New York"" pizza). Of the places I've had pizza in Manhattan (mostly the Original Ray's  one comes to mind immediately: SLOW. Took several minutes for staff to notice my entry (the ""seat yourself"" sign was out). Took several more minutes to get menus and drink orders in. Took over 10 minutes to get the server's attention to place the order for appetizers and main course. Took another 15 minutes for appetizers and FIRST drink refills. Main course another 15 minutes later SANS ONE ENTRE  and spicy pepperoni slices. Definitely will call them again; looking forward to dining in too! The place is adorably traditional from the outside. More? Yes please!!!!"  may be the first time I've ever asked for my money back. Soggy The guy running the place was very friendly as well! That always adds a star in my book. I'll go back on my next trip to Phoenix." Sandwich tasted good but was a bit too salty."  definitely stop in and have lunch at this Streets location.  I've been to a few other locations throughout the valley but none of them measure up to the consistency This ""pizza snob"" will not be returning for these pies..." If I could I'd give zero stars! I ordered 2.5 hours ago and the food just barely got here. The pizza had been sitting out for so long it was barely Luke warm and the cheese had gotten a hard like plasticity feel and taste to it. With all the time they took to get here you'd think they could at least give me more then 1 packet of ketchup for my fries (asked for xtra). To top things off the driver was extremely rude and tried to step in my house to grab the food when I called his work to discuss his behavior. Very disappointed and will NEVER ORDER AGAIN! Oh and to top if off they gave me 79cent soda from frys for my coke that I paid 2.50 for. This place sucks and had I known I could post pics on here I would posted a picture of it. My good friend was with me who just happens to be a cook at a fine dining restaurant in the area and choose toaster strudels over the crap presented so rudely at my door! #7 (the best of everything) is about the best sandwich ever."  when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing I ordered from this store this evening while General Manager Jimmy was on duty and my order was incorrect.  The french fries were not fresh and they neglected to send my 2nd order of macaroni salad.  I called to advise them of their error and was passed off to Jimmy who did not offer to compensate me for my trouble. He would be glad to send me what I paid for but would have to pay for my antipasto salad which i requested in place of my error in ordering the gluten free salad. This is the second time i have had a problem at this store.  This will be the last time i place an order with any Streets of New York. All in all.. we won't be back.. and I'll be sure to warn my friends.."  and cleanliness. The staff Jimmy and Austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented. The few times I've been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should I will definitely be ordering from here again." "Decided to try a new place for pizza delivery ... And sorry I made that choice. Ordered a margarita pizza and kids mac and cheese. Dry - both the pizza and Mac and cheese. I might give it a try again and order something else but first The service was fast. The little bread appetizers was a plus. I liked their ranch and marinara sauce. I did not like the soup. The pizza was good. The people there are friendly. I need to remember to give a review every single time we go. Of all the times The search continues for an excellent central Phoenix pizza delivery spot!" We stopped in last night after driving around trying to find a place. Pizza was like microwaveable. We ordered appetizers first. We then ordered our meals which all came out separate. I ordered garlic bread with my pasta it came out 20 min before my dinner. Pasta was cold cheese wasn't even melted on top. Wings were good. Pizza was hard and yuck! Staff was ok. Never again!  was excellent. I also had a slice of pizza that wasn't bad. I would have thought that the manager (I assume) would have stepped in to speed up the service. All in all Worst place ever. Ordered once and got really old chicken and fries. Plus half of the order was missing. Driv4er came back with some very old fries. Decided to try them again one more time. Got my delivery and the order was completely wrong ( the chicken was dried out and very old AGAIN!). Tried contacting restaurant and corporate office regarding my experiences and they refuse to get back with me. Dont waste your money here. Their food is old and disgusting!!!!! "The pizza was very decent. The wings were gross. The sauce was weird and definitely not traditional hot wing sauce.  The wings were dry and overlooked.  Good service  don't even bother with ""special instructions"".... It won't happen. And also for the record the XL slices are not that big. A more accurate description would be a small to medium slice... In my case it didn't matter because my slices went into the trash."  the girl on the phone couldn't even tell us where our food was or when it would be here. Really? So is it coming or not coming..... To eat or not to eat .... That is the question."  ordered 2 half orders of sandwiches with 6 wings. Both orders of wings were burnt. Last time we eat wings there Pizza was very good !!  My son who live local recommended ! I would have rated higher but parking lot had no lights so when 2 women pickup pizza not totally comfortable . Plus all workers were dressed Goth and we really did not feel comfortable . But pizza was good .  he returned from the bathroom and we waited for more minutes. After being told to take a seat you think they would know we were there. An associate and what we can only guess was the manager on duty made eye contact with us and never came over. After 15 yrs I cannot support this kind of company. I won't be returning. We left I have a gluten intolerance and found this place on findmeglutenfree.com.  They have gluten-free items marked on the menu which makes ordering much easier for people like me. I shared a GF pizza and wings with my boyfriend which we both enjoyed.  He had the free garlic knots which he said were just OK.  it's nothing spectacular but they do have a great vegetarian pizza!"  but the service was extremely poor. Food took forever to come out. Taste was just fair. The server was understanding and apologized a few times and acknowledged that the kitchen staff has been extremely slow. Wings were cold. Definitely will not be returning." Food is really good but the service we got from our server tonight was awful we needed refills and had dirty plates on the table. At first we thought she was just slow because she's pregnant but it was because she was more interested in her cell phone. *This may or may not have actually happened."  Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are ""en fuego."""  but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!"  but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???"  however I must say that I was not impressed with the wait. We were on a waiting list for over an hour LATE on a Saturday night... guess you pay for popularity." The wait kills me every time.  For the parking section of the review I really wanted to check the ""Yeah Right"" box.  haha." For Dessert! HAve the pizza-cookie (used to be called a pazookie)! Delicious!"  big drinks...what else could any shameful-sporadically-consumerist-americana ask for?" Order the huge cookie thing that has melted chocolate and ice cream in it. AMAZING! I think it used to be called Pazookie but they don't advertise it now apparently. One of the most amazing desserts The Original Pizza Cookie.  I was in a class at ASU with 29 ladies and they all voted Oregano's the best dessert." ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A one of the better places ive eaten since moving out here."  but I say that with a grain of salt. It is still better than most of the restaurants out there."  Phoenix was lovely in general!" ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A  can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink  it's is so much fun to sit outside and enjoy at any of their locations.!!"  but its only because everyone loves this place. Highly recommend the Pizookie! Large servings  the bread. All I know is that me and my gal ate way too much..and took some to go. I was very happy I will go back one day =)" I'm just too damn cranky for this overrated pizza joint  hot pizza to tide everyone over.  WARNING:  It may look like cheese but it's not...at least not when we were there.  I am a pretty strict vegetarian but had to laugh when I ate it and discovered there was pepperoni underneath the cheese.  Next time Dont leave without trying a macadamia nut pzookie!!!" I don't get it. I took my nephew there for lunch. He ordered pizza and I got an eggplant lasagna with a side of chicken and two drinks. The bill was $45! Completely ridiculous. When i asked the waiter he just went over the bill and that was it. Over priced and not even that great. The chicken was so salty and the pizza was burnt. Never going back. Go to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead."  I make a large exception for this local AZ wonder.  Can't wait to return Oreganos - next time we dine al fresco." We sat outside and were continually attacked by pigeons as we tried to eat. It was kinda of noisy too because the place was packed... even outside it was loud. (You would think the noise would have kept the pigeons away)."  eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!" I have never had to wait for a table at this location and the service is always great. The first time I ate here I was so overwhelmed by the menu there are so many options and all of them sound great. This isn't an authentic Italian restaurant but I like how they make all the classic dishes with a twist . The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The food here is pretty good try the Boom Dip as an appetizer and don't forget to leave room for the Pizookie its heavenly.  the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes  its a chain and the servers aren't perfect but come on now. Did anyone taste the pizza? We had the Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage and Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato and they were both fantastic. They have a good selection of beer I don't remember every server's name I have had there  call ahead and get it togo. I usually call about 1 and a half hours before I want it and get it hot and delicious!"  and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood  only the Beautiful Carin does that these days  it's amazing and the shrimp are more than few and freakin' Chernobyl sized! Can't beat the pzookie either..Be warned though.. you will expand on site Still awesome..for the very first time I tried their pizza. Had a friend in from out of town and we ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. Holy Crap..awesome. Crust wasn't doughy like I love it (personal preference)but it wasn't  Lavosh like either so I was pleased. The pizza had the perfect chipotle kick..it won't disappoint the spicy lovers but won't intimidate the spice shy. One word of advice though..don't bother taking home the leftovers if you plan to eat next day. Lettuce does NOT save well and neither do avocados. Ended up throwing 1/2 the pizza away :(  man!!   I've been to this place way too many times because it was hard for me to get Geno's Pizza in Chicago.  Every time I go to ASU I HEART Oreganos... The best thin crust pizza Ive had.. salads great... service awesome... I love the wines and the waiters that know them:-) PS.. aka let you even sample.. Friday nites on the Oreganos patio... with a good pizza pie and wine.. one of my favorite things:-) I'd go back here again but I wouldn't really be too eager to."  chances are the portions will be way too big for you. At least you're getting your money's worth My one and only request I ask everytime I go there is to open a store in west side. I love the place definitely pass on this one...... yuck......."  every day of the week....but try to do so sparingly because of the downfall for my diet. The prices are not bad at all and they have 1/2 portions for everyone's appetite. If you are in a hurry...they also do very efficient takeout orders. Also Slow. I'm not sure how many tables each server is assigned to but not only did we have to wait for our food Don't bother.  There are too many other options in the area with better food and service If you can get past the overpowering smell and taste of the garlic then it was a good dish.  But I must say the garlic is what ruined it for me.  Don't think I would go there again if I was in town." Awesome restaurant! Lots of choices on the menu. It takes at least 10 minutes to read through all of it. I recommend the thin crust pizza. It is to die for. Lots of options to choose from no matter what you are craving. Outdoor seating is nice as well. Their calzone is great.  it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders! I had an experience once where it was a 45 minute wait to eat there and a 1.5 hour wait for a to go order... WHAT?! And even when dining... the wait is pretty long... but I don't notice because I'm usually enjoying the company I'm with... so  you lost a $100 order this morning..who knows how many more you lost today or will continue to lose with this kind of  business practice. This would have been repeat business no less. I guess we'll take our repeat lunch business elsewhere and make sure we get the word out to all companies that enjoy ordering from Oregano's that you can't accommodate multiple togo orders at lunch time during the week M-F. You can't be oblivious to how many other restaurants can and will gladly accommodate? Can You? Good Luck to you." As far as pizza goes... Um no thanks. Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway. This place always seems to be busy but it is pretty good food.  Im big on pizza crust.  I like to believe it could make or break a pie.  Their crust is pretty darn good.  great atmosphere and nice patio. The servery brought a small plate with some bread dough to play with while we ordered and waited for the food. We had the Guaca Tony as appetizer  after adding red pepper flakes. But the Alfredo The Dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me. Was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta? The cheese wasn't melted My only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot Wish they would open a North Phoenix location!"  love the shrimp scampi and the bizookie! The portions are big. Customer service was excellent i will definately be back!" If you haven't been... you should go!" "I used to go here all the time for lunch to get their mini deep dish pizzas that are limited in supply and you better get there early because they go quick...because they are sooo good and they can feed two people almost.  But went there with the family last night and  you know how it can be kinda difficult to satisfy 4 people with the same pizza?  So we often do half and half to make everybody happy...and we've never ran into this situation  but you get the point." Check out the pictures!"  but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups  good sauce and lots of meat. My wife had the Grilled Italian Sausage Sandwich. You can tell the sausage was made in house with great spices and a little bit of heat. We will definitely go back."  and pizza cookies (left a little doughy with ice cream on top). The service is always great as is the atmosphere. The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it. Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch. Large patio area is a perfect place to eat most of the year. My go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad "I am madly in love with this restaurant! The pizza  sweet Wedgie of the Veg... i will sleep with visions of sugarplums... no wait... eggplant And I hear that they are expanding! Woo hoo! They can definitely use more room  :))"  it's phenomenal!  I'd fly back to PHX just for this cookie!"  and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also  and the fast service.  So kudos to Oreganos making my afternoon tasty as well as as easy."  wasn't too bad. I'd definitely like to try it again but dine in. :)"  and big enough for 2-3 to share. The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie. Even if you are stuffed order the pzookie cause when you see it and try it you will finish it!!!" So I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!" ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A  its a good one.  It is a bit cheesy (both in food and in sense of humor) but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good.  The price points are good and the service is friendly.  This place is always packed.  So be prepared for a wait.  They have pizza to please both fans of the thin crust or the thick.  Although if you get the thick crust pizza be prepared for a wait.  I always get the wedding soup which is delicious with meatballs and small bits of pasta in a chicken broth.  It is not too salty which makes me super happy!  If you're brave get a pizza cookie they can get it to have two different kinds of pizza dough and topped with vanilla ice cream." ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A I think this is the most of said on any of my reviews.  Will I go here again? Of course I will.  I live in Glendale and unfortunately  and a hearty menu for those who really like cheese and sweetness." The only thing I am disappointed in was the wait. I got to the restaurant and went to the pickup area. I guess one of the customers ahead of me had some sort of an issue "I've been here twice now and have to say that I cannot recommend anything here that is not a pizza. Their Chicago deep dish is pretty great for an Arizona chain and definitely worth the extraordinarily long wait. Did I say wait? Expect at least 45 minutes for your pizza.  Sweet jeebus  and I'm hoping to try the deep dish pizza soon."  and they bring them dough balls to play with.  The Pizookie (a giant mostly-baked cookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream) is inventive and a great way to share a dessery.  Servers are usually fun and attentive.  The only thing that stops us from going more often is that it's too damn crowded.  30 -60 minute waits are not uncommon." Eat at Oregano's because you will most certainly enjoy it."  or just have dessert for dinner with an ooey gooey Pizzookie Simply the BEST thin crust chicago style pizza in the state!! Worth every minute of the wait - wings are great too!! Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years I can see myself taking a trip back here. I look forward to trying some other menu items." "Stopped in for lunch last Friday to meet with a friend. Went at 12noon and was surprised to get a seat right away.  Although it was outdoor seating only available.  I ordered a sausage sandwich with the basket weave fries.. Delish.. love it.. although it takes a little while for food to come out  which made the experience even more enjoyable. Overall great food and atmosphere. Would definitely go back to check out some of their other pizzas."  I mean NO ONE does the thin crust pizza better that Oregano's. 'Tis a real shame this place is no where near my home on So Cal. Their sauce is the perfect amount of salty sweetness and the cheese blend they use is superb. I wouldn't mess around with those specialty pizzas they have on the menus because their classic traditional pizzas are top notch. Please come to So Cal Always have to try the chocolate chip cookie desert!! To die for!! "I was meeting a friend for lunch today at Oregano's. We got there promptly at 11 and got a parking spot and tablemmediately. We ordered calamari as a starter. This was the absolute worst calamari that I ever tasted! It didn't even look like calamari. It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood  plan on waiting.  The food is good (not great) but they have a variety of options for everyone.  The one thing that keeps me going back is their WINGS.  Medium-Gold is the way to go.  I would give those alone 5 Stars.  Probably in the top 3 best wings I've ever had.  The thin crust pizza is great but the one problem I've found with is it's very salty.  Luckily for them (and me) that just means I drink more beer.  The prices are average and the portions are large."  I decided to try different food. My friend and I arrived promptly at 11 and was immediately greeted by every employee. We started with the sweet potato fries. They were good "Tonight was near perfect.  Found a parking spot immediately.  We were seated right away on the patio.  Service was great and the food came quick.  Pepperoni thin crust was great and the wings were awesome as always.  Medium-Gold is the way to go and at $8.49 for 14 jumbo drums "After a long wait... I had the best stuffed pizza of my life. We waited about 45 minutes to get seated :-(....then the stuffed pizza takes 45 min. I didn't mind waiting for the pizza we knew it was gonna take that long. Absolutely the best stuffed pizza I have ever had Of course we had to order the half and half pzookie!" This place is always delicious. I always start off with the anti pasto salad...best I've ever had. Pizza is cooked perfectly with very fresh ingredients. And the desert choke is the best desert I have had. Mouth watering. This place has so much to offer and is always busy but always has great service!  even if we do have to wait 1.5 hrs for a table on busy weekend nights... just means more time to have a drink and chat with friends on the patio.  Enjoy!" Had the Chicago stuffed pizza and it was great!  Definitely worth waiting for.  We also shared a large dinner salad and it was really good and if you like spicy try the chipotle ranch dressing.  We sat outside and the weather was really nice and the tables were not too crowded together.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought sodas before we were finished as well as checking on us just enough to not be annoying.  Overall I would be a regular if I lived here but since I don't I'll just have to make a point of going every time I'm in Phoenix. Love the Big Rig. Servers are very friendly...and the meatballs are delicious! Oregano's is a comfy upbeat restaurant with great service and great food - an excellent time was had by all!" The food here is amazing! Pure Italian food freshly cooked. If you love amazing food that's a bang for your buck then this is your place. I recommend the Spaghetti with sausage and for desert their cookie with Ice cream Great food. Great service. Mark went out of his way to make sure we were taken care.  great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree You will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon." ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A PS-Service improved greatly. Guest services was waaaay nicer than they had to be. Never turn down a place that cares about your experience!"  service and dessert ever! I am addicted to Guacatoni!!!!"  and sometimes I like to indulge in the Dirty Monkey - it's delicious  but visit 3-4 times a year when passing through or visiting Phoenix. Best in the summer months with outdoor dining. Wish they had one in our California beach areas." I am from California and all I got to say is this place is the bomb. Garlic bread is awesome and so was the cheese stuffed pizza! I have never had a pizza with so much cheese!  and I was getting ready to leave without it.  The pizza was pretty good but nothing spectacular.  The food was decent and I would eat it again  but outside is heated and lovely all the time. The bar is nice here to sit at especially with small parties with always quick and available seating. Come here for good food." hmmm..is mediocre at best...the pazookie ice cream cookie is great and so is the atmosphere.."  mainly for the wings but for everything" This place is great.  The wait to get in is always long but it is worth the wait.  The chicken wings are the best I've ever had.  The service was great and their pizza is also wonderful.  You have to try this restaurant if you haven't.  juicy tomatoes. No hating necessary--this is a Phoenix pizza joint that's worthy of the Chicago label! If we ever make it back to Phoenix  salad and calamari. Very very good. The service was also great. GREAT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE= 5 STARS. We live in the west side and would drive to come to this place!!! The waiters Michael and Keith was were excellent!!" Awesome service waitress was awesome and brought a friend here he loved it =) 2/26/2012 I would drive all the way from Cali to have some of this stuff again! Amazing!"  less sodium in the food is the only critique?" **Only reason they are getting four stars is the parking and wait. It can get a little long for the wait so don't come hungry...you will get grumpy (MEEE). Parking sucks too so you will have to find a spot on the street somewhere (this location is not in the greatest areas of Phoenix so lock your car)." PS: Tell your people to stop yelling at customers on the way out to ""have a great night This location is my favorite... Not sure why... But it just is.... Love the chicken Alfredo after dark pasta!  and he had a meat combo-pepp and sausage. So delicious. The only complaint he had was the parking situation there. It is kind of tough  pass on the staff attitude.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed pizza on Sunday evening.  The waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches.  After suggesting what size he thought I could handle  but I believe they were astonished at the drop in business due to the end of spring training and did not know what to do with so many servers on.  This will not deter us from returning  and on the few occasions I've been here was a long wait. Expect about 20 - 30+ min before your seated during the lunch hours. If you're here by yourself I want to emphasize the really great service.  We were asked how our meal went  but is it worth the time or the crazy amount of calories? No." Our server even offered me a refill to go. Nice touch." ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A "Been coming here for almost a year now. I've had every pasta dish and the thin crust pizza. Everything was so good. Make sure to get an order bruschetta for an appetiser. That really makes the whole meal for me. On the service end "AWESOME FOOD!!!  I don't know why I've been in AZ 11yrs and this is my 1st visit  here. AWESOME  can't wait to go back again." Good pizza. Fun atmosphere. Consistent.  or at least they would train their servers to be more careful about warning customers about the time it takes for certain foods to come out like other restaurants." "The ""Big Rig"" Pasta calls my name more often than I'd like. Living close to this much delicious pasta and deep dish pizza is rough on the waist line. Always great service  that does not bother me really.  We were seated pretty quickly.  Ordered Lawrence's Original Pizza (my favorite there) as well as an Antipasto salad.  The pizza was good but took forever to arrive.  The salad was terrible and I had been so looking forward to it.  I may give them another chance at this location  but were super hungry so we wanted to order the stuffed mushroom app (seemingly the only somewhat healthier choice) and were told it would take 45 min for those since they were baked. Skipped it too then. The food here is good  if you are going for dinner get there with time to spare and have a cocktail on the patio while you wait for your table "This place is a great local family Italian restaurant. Great food I'll give it another try before I take these guys our of my rotation.  We usually get take out anyway." Customer service ..food everything about this place is good had the stuffed pizza ..also for dessert i recomend the pizza cookie ..if you try it you will want to go back!  right after work we'd head over here for some delicious pizza and AMAZING salad! Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad. was sent from heaven  it's SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food Best meatball sandwich! Rivals my mommas. Worth it!  you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there." I dined outside and had no wait. I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked up to the hostess stand. As soon as I sat down the waitress came by to gather my drink and appetizers. I did not get an appetizer this time. The food came out quickly and the follow up from the waitress was great. The waitress and other wait staff did a good job waiting tables. I notice them working with other tables. Everyone seemed very happy. I will dine again but will order a different type of Pizza. This restaurant has a variety of different options to choose from." DUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage  they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man Arrived at 11:05 and there was a line waiting to be seated.  Not sure why they don't seat people since there were tables on the patio open and once we were seated inside there were at least 6 empty booths and tables.  When we walked inside there was a really unpleasant fish smell but it seemed to subside.  Service a little spotty and it took a while for the food to arrive. We always get the Anti pasta salad and a pizza.  The salad was really good and the pizza tasty though it was slightly soggy in the middle pieces. Our server asked us if we wanted desert when she brought us the pizza which seemed liked she wanted us to eat and get out.  Overall it was okay and I would probably go back but I would not wait in any line to get in.  There are too many other choices out there to pay for an ok experience.  and their pizza is pretty good too."  and pizza cookie. The sausage will surprise you as it has just a kick of spice to make your mouth water. They took away the lasagna and just brought it back again. I hope they keep it permanently because it is hands down the best I've ever had and I'm a fanatic about lasagna. Pizza cookie is a must have. Macadamia nut is out of this world but you can also split out with chocolate chip if you can't decide." We only go back because others want us to join them. We never go on our own."  love this location. Long waits to be expected."  but it was NOT worth waiting 45 minutes for...nor was the whole meal worth $50.00+ for one 12"" pizza  so I didn't feel bad. I will come back if I am tired of other choices.  The twins ate everything.  My little boy even ""thanked"" the server for the yummy pizza.  The poor boy has no taste "My absolute favorite ""chicago"" style pizza. The best thin crust pizza....... ever! I love the super crispy edges of this amazing pizza. This place is usually pretty busy and parking well.. sucks. Definitely plan on being here a little longer than most restaurants you visit. We always order the pizza cookie Food is delicious but they take for ever to bring the food. We been waiting for 1hr. I am in love with this pizza. I love the crust! I can't eat cheese or meat so I ordered a veggie pizza without the cheese and it was heavenly! I wish there was one closer to where I live. "Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting  not many places can get just the right amount of crispy and just the right amount of meaty when it comes to chicken wings and for my taste these guys nail it. I give the wings 5 stars hands down I will put Oregano's up against anyone in town for chicken wings. I have tried multiple locations and they are consistent at all three that I have tried. The only thing that is frustrating is that they are always busy and the situation to get a table can be a bit irritating when you have been waiting all week for cheat day...and speaking of cheat day the pizzookie or whatever it is called is super good as well if you are in the mood to pack on about 2500 calories in one meal these guys are one of the best places to blow a clean eating streak."  but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed" Can't say anything bad about this place. Food is always consistently good." We decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list...." "I love this restaurant! I have been coming here for years. They also have great service. The only thing is that they don' take reservations. It is a first come  I'll I had was the ""Fried Calamari""  It was Good not the best I've had but not the worst either. The atmosphere was real nice. If you ever been to Oregano's you know it takes awhile to get your food even when you seat at the bar. I'll go again but not in any rush"  it's already known this a great pizza joint offering thin crust culinary delights but what I want to share in this review is their wings.  Whoa!  Definitely worth ordering on every visit.  Crunchy  and long waits--which are worth it." "If you walk out of this place and you are not happy you need to see a shrink.  Probably best people in town (i know people love to debate that).  But if you love BJ's pizza Newport Beach  drinks and pizza cookie!!!"  amazing service. What else can I say? You may have a long wait  I give big dings for the long wait for food (usually after sustaining a pretty long wait just to get a table) and the fact that they refuse to take reservations for large parties making it an absolute nightmare of a wait for a large group to eat there.  For that reason alone  was extremely friendly and attentive and made sure we were comfortable during our wait. We also got a small dinner salad with house italian. It was delicious and a decent portion. Finally our pizza came. It was huge! (we ordered the 10'). We really enjoyed it  their is no presentation.  Apparently all wine tastes the same to these people.  If your gonna sell wine "Though the food is wonderful I believe our server was unaware of the menu options since he couldn't repeat a single item ordered back to us properly. In the end our pan pizza was served as a thin crust. The dinner salad  because their pizza takes time to cook. I look at this place and see they make all their food with extra love; I am more than willing to wait and pay the price for eating their delicious food. Oh Not so great.  The hot wings were not good. The flavor was bland and had hardley any sauce.  I had the stuffed numero one-o that tasted very bland and had too much cheese so it melted on my plate. The person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good. The wait was extremely long which eould have been okay if food had been worth it. On top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza. I would not recommend this place.  however I can honestly say that about Oregano's. I fell in love with this place from the first time I ate there and I've never looked back. I've tried a lot of pizza in my 27 years here as a Phoenix native  this all being in the first two minutes we were there. Dinner came and as soon as our plates were delivered we were asked if we were going to have a pazooki and what kind so our server could put in our order right away. Even after saying we wanted to eat our dinner first she insisted on putting it in because it takes 10 minutes. I actually like to enjoy my food and the people I'm with when going out to eat. The whole experience was rude. Will not be back at this location again."  but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!" my wife have been there about 5-6 times since we moved here from just south of Chicago. they have some of the best pizza around and we have a great time every time we go there I keep wanting to give them another try Be sure to save room for the Pizza Cookie w/Ice Cream."  and the pizza cookie. My  mouth is watering just thinking about it. The parking is usually frustrating  but my experience was with their takeout service. Couldn't have been more friendly. The food was as good as ever and it was ready right on time. Love oreganos and the people that work there." The family and I eat here regularly and this place never fails us. The kids beg for the pizza cookie so I use that as leverage for them to clean their rooms when we get home haha. But seriously good food though! Why is it always crowded?  Seems like everyone loves Oregano's.  A varied menu with great choices especially pizzas and sandwiches.  Great service.  Easy parking. A salad is big enough for an entire family!  The server always asks us if we want a traveler for our ice tea.  Sometime to remind you of your dining pleasure on your way home. I love love love their Boom Dip!!! It is to die for!!! Every time I just want one all to myself! They also have Excellent Salads! If you are wondering whether or not to go  here.... The answer is yes!!!  never lets me down. Food is amazingly delicious! The only flaw is how long it takes for them bring out your food. By the time the food comes out your about to chew on the flesh of the person right next to you because your so hungry."  Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.  If you think you don't like Oregano's  and deep dish is my hangover cure!  Oregano salad is the best! Cheesy bread is great!  Top notch service A very big thanks to ""Aire-Bear"" of PDX for this wonderful experience. BTW his favorite is the Big Rig." We had Oregano's cater a party at our home. Jane the head of catering was amazing to work with and the staff  they sent to our home were great. The food was delicious as always and they made the party a hit. Everyone really enjoyed themselves! Fresh food and the service is great 90% of the time.  Only complaint is the frequent wait list. Looove this place!! Service is really good and food is amazing! There is a long wait some days but it's totally worth it! Staff is always friendly. Pizza could use more flavor IMO. Vino bambino salad is awesome!!! ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A "Food is great every time along with excellent customer service. Everyone is so enviting I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever! He was rude and never came to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything! He kept passing by but would never come to our table. I was so disappointed! "After reading the reviews about the wait I was skeptical about coming here but I tried it anyway. The service was outstanding. Friendly people were all over this place ready for anything. I ordered the potato rosemary pizza. Good pizza isn't rushed. Why are people so impatient. The pizza was amazing. The atmosphere was inviting. I will definitely be going back. Oh yeah. I forgot my card going out to my car  nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent ." "Went in Nov of 2013 and I must admit this place is addicting! I've always wanted to try a Chicago style deep dish Pizza since I first learned about it on Travel Channel back in 2005! During visit in Phoenix some friends took me to try this place out. They swore up and down that it was good. Reason for being adamant was because I've been to other places and have been majorly disappointed by claims of being so called deep dish when in reality is was bread fluffed up with smeared tomato sauce. I can attest  not to be discouraged! Pizza here is always comforting! :)" Expect a wait especially after 6 on Thurs and Fri. Sometimes an hour or longer. I really like the Boom Dip and Pizookie but I try to go during off times cause nothing's THAT good. Our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so many great authentic locations in Phoenix I doubt I will be back."  I couldn't help but crave deep dish pizza on a regular basis. This place didn't disappoint me at all! Truly Excellent!" "First time trying this place since moving from California.  We came on a Friday night and the wait was an hour and 30mins. Was a little disappointed but since it was our first time there we decided to stick out the long wait.  While we were waiting they brought out samples of cheese pizza which were fresh out of the oven and super yummy.  After being there for 40 mins they sat us down.  We wanted to try everything since it was our first time there. We ordered the garlic cheese bread  and always been treated with respect and kindness QY09z2M_tno4Xa1rnPa9iQ  the service here is always awesome. I'm come here anytime I'm in the area. Five stars!!"  but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The salads are HUGE! Oh "Service personnel are incredibly polite and always smiling. The food is above average and the biscotti was fantastic. The amount of food was such that there is always some left over to tomorrow's lunch. The interior could use a bit of sprucing up as it is showing its age. Very family friendly Pasta is amazing. Really well cooked and good portions. Pizza is really good. Huge juicy wings with great flavor. Giant cookie with ice cream is a must. When our meal came out the pizza was definitely the best part. We got both thin crust and deep dish pizza and I enjoyed both. We got a pasta as well and I thought it was just meh. I wouldn't order it again. We got the cookie dough dessert which was also delicious. Overall the meal was super good "This is really good pizza.  There will be a wait and parking is difficult to find.  But I love I'm not a fan of the old old 1950's music very annoying"  kind and caring. We get the same food most all the time. Big beefstro salad is what we had. Always made right  very Friendly... Ryan. Lots of great choices in food. Yummmmm" Very greasy needs spices"  our waitress explained that the deep dish pizza we ordered would take about 45 minutes to arrive.  We ordered 2 tossed  salads with ranch to tide all 4 of us over until the main course arrived.  The salads were huge and easily accommodated all 4 of us.  The service while we waited was fabulous- water was brought repeatedly "I love Oreganos! I work here and I know it may seem clich to say I love everything about this place but I honestly do! My coworkers are the best If you come in the evenings the wait can be anywhere from 20-45 minutes." Food was consistent with the other Oreganos in town. The staff was attentive. Parking was terrible. "Excellent service with a friendly environment. The decor is interesting "Hmm.. mixed emotions about this one. I was looking forward to a nice chewy gooey yummy mess of lasagna. If you just love spinach so much that you want the entire dish to be permeated with spinach flavor Food was great and filling but takes a long time. They did warn us it would be an hour for the pizza but we still got tired of waiting. If you can save some room for the skillet cookie!  no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant." Best pizza in phoenix hands down. Their portions are huge and the price is extremely reasonable. A must every single time I'm in town! First time eating here. We came with our daughter and her friend for a b-day dinner. Portions are very large and the food was delicious! VERY DISAPPOINTING !!!" ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A This place is always hopping. You need to get there at 11.oo am for lunch . The staff was friendly and attentive . Their prices are very reasonable and portions large . My spaghetti was  a little over cooked and the sausage was overcooked . I  like their marinara.  I should have sent my dish back but I was too hungry This could totally be a biased review because I've only been one time and tried one thing - the stuffed pizza!  Which to me is more like a huge hot pocket or some sort of Italian casserole with crust.  Wasn't a fan at all!  I do tend to give the place another shot because it was PACKED that Friday night I picked up my unsatisfying stuffed pizza!  Oh and it was expensive!  I remember that! "Don't try and do take out with this place in less you want to wait all night.  Called tonight at 6pm to order a pasta dish (no pizza) and was told it would not be ready until 8:30pm - no place is worth waiting over 2.5 hours for a take out order.  Called STREETS OF NEW YORK  the toppings delicious.  The salads (antipasto and Idon't remember the name of the other one.  The wings were also fantastic  golden wings & margarita pizza. Pb/Choc chip pizookie is a must!!" Visiting from Tacoma and Oregano ' s was recommended.  The salads are huge... and the pizza was excellent too.  Ryan our server was tops.  Very attentive.  Atmosphere like you are in Italy.  I will definitely return.  and we went back on our way home to Chicago. My boyfriend wanted to bring one back for his friends but we couldn't figure out how to bring it back"  this is a must visit to this place. I had the lunch portion of the Alfredo in the Dark pasta and it was filling. I wouldn't dare to order the dinner portion for lunch unless you are REALLY hungry. I highly recommend this place when visiting or living in Phoenix.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are excellent with their service and great waitstaff."  and friendly. The best part was with the reasonable prices even with 20 adults we didn't have to break the bank. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love many items here but my favorite is the Italian stuffed grinder. (Or sub sandwich as I guess some people call it)... and a must have is their pizza cookie.  The only downside is their parking situation. Be prepared to park and walk since their actual parking lot fills up fast." I always come here to get my pasta fix. The employees are always nice and the place is always clean. atmosphere casual and price and portions are reasonable." Ya'll need more locations in town though...just sayin! ;)" First time to Oregano's.  We'll be back.  Extensive menu.   We chose pizza and it was delish!   Music a little too loud but we'll definitely go back. I'm originally from Chicago...so pizza is my thing...this place is special  but the service was even better!! Shoutout to Ryan S. for being the best guy out there! Made us feel very welcome coming from California! Would definitely come back!"  and we were greeted multiple times from everyone there. We perused the menu and decided to try their deep dish pizza (which they warned us ahead of time would take 40-50 minutes to make) so in the meantime we got the deep fried ravioli with jalapeo cheese and it was very good! We also got 2 almost 24oz beers to go with it and the price was decent for those. We finally got our pizza and it was delicious! We were a little wary of the price but since it's deep dish The Camelback location has been our 'home' Oregano's since we moved to Phoenix. The parking here is a little tight and you'll often find yourself pulling up to the curb on one of the streets behind the restaurant. But the staff is great and there is adequate seating for your pre-meal wait. That all said Super impressed! Being from Chicago pizza has to be really good. This was such a delight! Great service! Awesome antipasti salad! Gosh. I don't know how I've never been here before. The food is just outstanding. I had the salad with thin beef slices and it was a salad like no other. The dressing was nicely mixed in and with the perfect level of spiciness. The wings were also delectable. The waitress was nice. Environment also nice.    not much positive to say.   I was craving Alfredo.   What I got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste.   I wondered where the sauce was and found it coating the soggy garlic bread stuffing into the bottom of the dish.  Would have loved the tasty garlic bread crisp and by itself rather than soaking up all the sauce and leaving the dish very unsatisfactory.  Also asked for their specialty drink ""up""  -- it came with ice in a martini like glass -- although otherwise tasty.   Good service.   But will look elsewhere for my pasta fix." This is an outstanding restaurant!!!. We had the garlic bread with cheese. Portabella mushrooms. and the deep dish pizza. The service was great. The garlic bread was huge and delicious. The portabella mushrooms were maybe a tiny bit under cooked but had a wonderful flavor. The piece-de-resistance though was the PIZZA. It was simple wonderful. To much food for three people. We enjoyed the left overs the next day. We are only in Phoenix for a month but will visit here again before we leave. As a side note; If you are in a hurry eat elswhere. The wait was 30 min. and the deep dish pizza takes 45min. to cook. It was worth it!!!! Nice weather and waiting for a friend  vegetarian. :) andddd it's a must to get a chocolate chip pizzookie! Heaven!!!l"  when I picked up my order it was incorrect.  When I kindly asked questions his tone was very unpleasant and rude and you could tell he was not happy to be taking my order and wanted to get off the phone. When I asked questions after paying to the cashier Senyaceth "Was afraid it would be just another generic chain with stale salads and overly greasy frozen-fried food. Nope! Freshest salads  but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies  but if you haven't you should go and experience it for yourself.  There can often be a wait so be patient."  this was our first time here and they had great food kid loved it nice place to hang out and have some great Italian food!!! Oh yeah and expect oregano and lots of it" ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A  engaged and pleased to please us! AND the place was clean! (which is a big plus in my book!)"  but once we were served by Kevin . It was worth the wait!! I have no words other than we had a great service.(best service in my entire life!!) thanks Kevin defenetly coming back." What a nice surprise ..the soup was to die for..huge meatball fresh mozzarella ..the pizza was very good as well..will defiantly come back.  joyful service to come here. And always remember T I P S = To Insure Proper Service. Tip your server Don't eat here. The WORST experience ever. Our 20 minute wait was close to an hour. No apology and definitely no better service. Even the food came out cold and stale/hard/coldish. What used to be out favorite place has gone to shit.  Avoid this location.  you gotta know what to order." Room for improvement - Think about a water filtration system. It's tap water with a nasty aftertaste. Affects the flavor of ice teas and other drinks. Reservations would be great or at least the ability to put your name on a waiting list when wait is over 30 minutes." Of course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)" Jose H. was such an amazing server! So accommodating and really made the experience one to remember. Food was also 5 stars! Get the Pablo Picasso I just dont understand how this place is 24/7 busy with people waiting crazy time periods to sit down. We went at 3:30! today and it was still busy as hell. I gusss its a good problem to have"  beyond happy I did! We had a salad and the zany zity pasta; both were huge portions enough to feed two. Our check was $21 which was a steal for all the food we had. From the food to our terrific server (Kelsey) Even better than I remember! Parking was easy even on Friday night. Short wait to eat inside or we could have been seated immediately outside. We chose inside seating. The calamari was amazing and even the 9 and 6 year old ate some! We had the Puerto Penasco Carne Street Pie on thin crust and it was AWESOME. The kids ate their noodles with various toppings. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating for our family of 5. It was great to come back to Phoenix and get enjoy one of our favorite places that's still rocking it!  relaxing ambience; with indoor and outdoor seating." A warm chocolate chip cookie doused in vanilla ice-cream just makes everything about life better. One of my favorite places to eat but .......today this server is not very good he is nice enough but i asked for side of extra sauce and 20 min later he asked if i got it another 15 min later still no sauce food is cold i shouldhave ate outside with the bartender i knew ......then with no sauce in hand he boxes my food which i had barley eaten and charged me for the sauce ive never recieved...:( HORRIBLE experience so far and we haven't even been sat down yet... Longest hour of my life so far! The garlic bread is amazing! I ordered a salad that would have easily fed 2.  The food was good and the prices reasonable.  Would totally go back! The service here was horrible our server would take 20 minute increments to check on us!  but my meal was overpriced."  very good and a reasonable price.. Best salads in town.. The place is always packed." Consistently good. Every. Single. Time. We've been to several locations and have never been disappointed.  un-appealing dressing. Entree salad was fair. Shrimp diablo was too hot. I love spices food but this was ridiculous. Starchy cream sauce with only three or four shrimp. No bargains here on lunch entree costs. Choose another restaurant if you truly love Italian food." Not sure I will go back for a while"  we ate at Oregano's.......twice......in three days. We left absolutely stuffed. The pizza is amazing but the half baked cookie with ice cream.....that is what I want my last meal to be. I only wish we lived in Phoenix." It was my first time here and was a spur of the moment decision to go. I ordered the Monday lunch special 2 slices of Chicago thin crust with one having bacon and pine apple and the other sausage and onion I also added the garden salad and a appetizer of the calamari. My husband orders the Monday lunch special 6 in Chicago deep dish and a Caesar salad and we both had dr pepper to drink . It wasn't so busy when we arrived the host he was amazing very friendly and enthusiastic wish I knew his name but I can say he isn't boring . Our server was Jules she was also friendly and gave good service. Now the food is where they fell short we ordered the calamari way before the meal and our salads arrived before the calamari which my salad was not a garden salad but romaine and two very thinly sliced tomatoes and two pieces of thinly sliced red onion with ranch . When the calamari arrived it was over cooked and rubbery with a fish flavor I have only had calamari two other places and they were really good so I was disappointed in the flavor and rubbery calamari. The pizza arrived and I was told the next time I had to get both slices with the same toppings I looked at my pizza and to my disappointment I received Canadian bacon instead if bacon as I specified as bacon bacon. Then as I was eating my sausage and onion slice I noticed the fork I was using had a huge piece of dried shaved Parmesan cheese on the handle it went from the end of the fork to half way to the prongs of the fork. I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars . I may try them again but not too sure right now and we tipped Jules 15 bucks for being so awesome and she was very apologetic and earned it . "Have been going to Oreganos for years. This one doesn't seem to have it together. Tried to serve our ""appetizer"" after our the main meal was served. Couldn't wait to take our order and get us out of here. Food was ok but not up to normal. Disappointed in the last few visits at this location." This was my first time at this particular location and the food was just okay. I think the one on Scottsdale  road is better.  But my server was amazing ! Her name is Dru be sure and ask for her  you won't be disappointed ! Love this place! The waiter Giovanni made my first experience marvelous.He's so polite and patient helped us figure out what would be tasty ! Definetly will return cause of him . Fifty minute wait for our order during lunch when it wasn't busy at all.  The waitress didn't seem to want to pay much attention to us or offer any kind of information as to what the status of our order was.  The food was alright but the customer service was poor.  Will not be coming back and wouldn't recommend. Best place for a food baby." "if you come here I suggest you eat inside. when I called for takeout the girl kept saying ""um"" as if she didn't really know what she was doing. I arrived early   and waited. ...again.   Finally we flagged down another employee who was walking by and asked for a box and our check.   Our waitress finally brought the check and I had to ask her for a box as well.  If she had acknowledged the fact that my hubby had to help himself in order to get a refill  EVERY. SINGLE. EMPLOYEE!  That is rare these days and it was nice to see.  I can't wait until they open the Oregano's out near my house in Surprise.  I know I will come here often.  The pizza is fantastic and the service has been 5 stars both the times I have been to an Oregano's.  Good stuff!"  the pizza was absolutely PERFECT. The pricing dissapoints me the most really. If it were cheaper  we visit here at least once. Wonderful pizza and cookie dessert." Ordered four different items and all of them are way to salty. Not your traditional Italian food. I would recommend Maggiano's or Anzio's. FYI Maggiano's is a scratch kitchen! "It was our first night at Oreganos as a blended family. I'm the mom and I've finally met the man of my dreams. We bought a house just down the way. Unfortunately- our ticket got lost. We were happily enjoying a bottle of wine and conversation and before we could eve ask what happened... A manger came out and took care of everything. We even were moved to a table with a heater- as we were outside and it was cold. Thank you Oreganos  their cheesy bread is great! But also filling! (Appetizer)" "I never go to Phoenix without a visit  (or two) to Oregano's. The Big Rig with a couple ""Bangers"" are a must. Portions are huge and consistent . The employees seem to love working there as the service is always great. Great pre game dinner place before the Blackhawks spank the Coyotes. Thanks Mark!" ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A Super solid meal overall. Finally starting to understand the rave reviews. Maybe next time I'll actually grab a slice."  and I say that being very self-aware in my yuppie-ness. The pizza's classic and plenty tasty "To be fair I tried Oregano's twice in 2 different locations. I have tried lots of pizza in Arizona from many different restaurants. Everyone told me I had to try Oreganos....AND I can't figure out why!! The pizza is SOOO MARGINAL. No really Was my first time coming in and loved it. The pizza was awesome and I loved my cookie ice cream dessert at the end!  with ice cream and chocolate sauce). Yummmm. Plenty to take home and have tomorrow for breakfast."  and food. Enjoyed a Chicago thin crust Numero One-O and garlic bread. It is refreshing to find a great pizza chain this good." "I LOVE this place. It's been a family favorite for years and years. Amazing thin and deep dish pizza! Ginormous  most of the time. It always seems to be busy. The wait time can be long. Take out is long as well and it can be pricey. It's a casual and comfortable environment."  give them another try. The food is great and the service is outstanding. Sit with Jimmy outside if you can  but I've noticed their portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller.  Don't get me wrong "Food is always abundant.. I just really really wish it didn't take 40 mins to get an eggplant parmesan and meatball sandwich. Sadly  especially when you are working in the industry where hungry people are at your door at all times." Definitely not a return for me." Even though the wait time can get crazy this is always a great place to eat.  Good food. Great service.  And awesome belinis!!  Keep coming back! "I love this place! The food and atmosphere is amazing although theres always atleast a 30 minute wait the food and service you recive is definitely worth it all. For first timers i recommend the big rig pasta Loved it!! Excellent pastas and meatballs. Thin crust pizza. Sever Miguel was awesome!! The portions are GIANT and delicious. The staff is quick and friendly. I wish so badly that I didn't live in another state because I would eat here all the time!!  what I did not understand was how it was sitting on top of the food countered and it took 15min for it to reach our table. I also was not too thrilled with the pizza cookie at the end  waited 10 minutes for a box for our left overs only time the waiter was waiting was when I was pulling out my credit card." The take our server told us 35 minutes and when we arrived 5 minutes early she said it was actually an hour. She the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us. We ordered a cold salad and wings. Yikes! Take out could use some refinements since busy is always standard so that is no excuse. "I love Oregano's and my hubby and I go to various locations throughout the valley. Every time we order takeout from this location we have nothing but problems and bad service. Today: our order took 45 minutes longer than promised. After finally asking the young lady to check again she laughed and said ""oh it's been ready a while now"". The meatballs in our order were so badly burned they tasted like feet so we had to throw those out.  Also The food here is amazing. We had the brussel sprouts that are to die for. We also ordered a house salad. Their salads are ginormous! Almost obnoxious.  We also had the wheat crust BBQ pizza. All fantastic.  Can't wait to go to Oregano's again next time we are in AZ.  and it was the perfect size for me! If you don't want to wait for hours And the cookie? The singular best restaurant dessert anywhere and what a value!" "Love this place! I've been going here for years with friends and family for all sorts of events. Definitely a place for small or big get-togethers. Expect a wait time of at least 15 minutes  then got there early just in case and had to wait ten minutes just for them to talk to me. They went to check on my pizza and had to wait another ten minutes for them to come back and tell me they gave my pizza away to another table. They offered to start a new one  the way your foot stuck to the ground was the enough for you to know.The people that came after us received there food before us. 50 minutes later we finally got our food. Our server was being nice but his tone made it noticeable that it was all sarcasm. When the food came out the guacamole looked unappetizing; coloring was a dead giveaway that it wasn't going to cut it. When asked to have a new batch "Ate here yesterday and I'm never going back.  I got there at around 4 45 pm and even though we were once of the only people in our section at the time of arrival we were the last to get our food after several other parties had sat down and ordered.  Mind you we only ordered one salad and one pizza. The salad was good but the pizza took incredibly long to get finished. Our server didn't seem very attentive and rarely stopped by to see if we needed a refill or to even say anything about how soon our food would be ready. Finally got refills only to come back with a dead fly in my cup. The pizza finally came and practically fell apart in a saucy mess the moment you touched it. The kitchen barely made an effort to cut the crust which was extremely hard and kinda burnt. Overall this place was just a let down. Several people had recommended it to me and hyped it up. I guess if you want to wait forever for your food I feel bad giving Oreganos a poor review because I have been to most of there locations several times and it is always pretty good. Just a don't try to pick up food for take out. I waited one hour for take out food and they apparently lost my order and never prepared it. Unfortunately I waited exactly 1 hour for the food and then they told me I could wait another 15 min and they will actually cook it this time. I was to frustrated to wait any longer so I just left empty handed. Just dine in when you eat here and be prepared to wait for a little while.  everything I've ever ordered there has always been delicious. The stuffed rigatoni is my absolute favorite. No matter the time of year If they can revamp their wait staff operation this place certainly could be great."  I personally asked for sundried tomatoes on them and I swear they made the dish extra yummy! My family and I went to celebrate my sister's graduation. We waited about 10 minutes then were seated in a  booth. I really don't have any complaints besides there being a ton of flies inside Oh and don't forget the pizza cookie!"  this place is great for dates especially when your high af with your girl on her birthday" Consistent across the board. Friendly people. Clean dining room. Really good food that is an excellent value for the money. Unlike so many local restaurants Ohhhh also the first visit they had come to ask us if we wanted to order a deep dish pizza while we wait so that when we got seated it'll be ready for us to enjoy.. I think that was pretty awesome and smart thing to do. We will be back oregano! Sometime next week :) I'm soooo ready. Hahaha." In the last year our experiences here have been SO much better. Maybe it's because we've stopped ordering take out from the untrained teens at the host stand and sitting on the patio where you're ignored for an hour. We've stuck to the bar and been happy campers ever since.  Loved the place. Staff is very friendly and the food was great. Me and my children will surely be returning. The Chicago style thin crust pizza was amazing and the chocolate chip pizza with ice cream dessert made our meal even better. It would have gotten 5 stars but the wait for a table was a little to long." Oregano's is now a must hit joint for me anytime I end up in Phoenix or near Phoenix. Go check it out you will not be disappointed." "This review is hard because the food is spectacular but the lack of parking and wait times make it not worth the time to go eat there. I have been to Oregano's about 3 times in my life because I avoid those two things unless I really want Oregano's food. The last time we went Large servings for all their plates.  Chicken wings are soooooo spicy.  It's legit!  Their pasta dishes are delicious and not two entres are alike.  Pizza is by far THE BEST on their Menu!    I'm not a huge pizza lover but I crave Organos pizza ALL THE TIME." It you desire good family style dinners on an empty stomach  wait was long to sit inside but we got seated immediately outside. Service was good. Nothing to ride home about. The uber driver that picked us up said we should've ate at the parlor My pasta (Alfredo the dark) was a nice lunch portion but slightly dry with not enough sauce  you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion BTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri)."  great quality and variety. Pepperoni auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ  whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment."  but sadly for me I live two blocks south of the cut off point. Boo hoo." I say pizza is like sex. And this place is one helluva orgasm." auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ They do serve Mt Dew and have WIFI for free. (the code is 1234567891 A true winning ""bistro""." Wish they had a full bar to sit at that would be fun and an outside venue too." auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ  I have found other restaurants that I feel very at home in. This has been on of my favorites.......till now.............  I usually come during the day time to avoid the   candle light atmosphere. I bring my lap top (WIFI free) but I came in  tonight and found the music so annoying. If only they would get real musicians that sound good while dining instead of the young kid who is ALWAYS there  I will miss this place when I move (Including Eric & Jimmy Lee play those oldie hits). I stand by my last review...best pizza anywhere around. Great atmosphere (yep  lousy service!  I have been buying take out pizza from Pizza Heaven for some time now (even back  when  they were on 7th and about Highland).  So I  decided to dine in once.  What a  mistake.  We sat for over 30 minutes and no  service.  The place wasn't that  busy but apparently business  is so good they don't have to wait on customers.  If you want take out  and I have been hooked ever since. Its something in the sauce  not the best I've ever had.  It's cheap; you can get 2 cheese slices & a drink for $4. $0.50 per topping per slice.  Friendly staff "oh yeah they updated the soy cheese used to a vegan version and it is super tasty! Get some tonight  especially the pizza. There are vegetarian options. Good salads and sandwiches. Tasty pasta dishes. Free wifi. They sometimes have live entertainment that not everyone appreciates (psst  Pizza Heaven. You've remained solid in my heart since the day I drove into town and stayed at the only hotel on the only street I could recall in this wonderful City. I ;hearts& PHX." "I love this place! Great pizza at a great price! This place is clean and for the price can't be beat! Is this place Pizza Blanco? No  but I can think of 20 pizza places that are better than this and many of those 20 are cheaper."  heck yes!) and a to-go menu on my way out the door. We'll surely be back." Thank you for catering to us pain-in-the-ass children that were put on the planet to make everyone's life difficult!" I will try this place again and dine in next time "You know that smell a plate gets that hasn't been washed properly after you eat eggs or chicken? That's what Pizza Heaven's wings taste like. Not to mention they were chewy almost as if the wings had been reheated in a microwave and then ""fresh"" sauce was poured on top. I asked to please have my wings remade and it was the same thing over again. The waitress mentioned that their wings are baked and that might be reason for the consistency of the meat and the smell. Oh  but sometimes I just want to eat pizza and have a conversation with my friends.  If the band is playing or setting up "I have been coming here for three years and I have yet to find a better pizza joint in town.  My family and I come every Friday night to hear the live music-eric and jimmy are awesome!  For all you haters  it was pretty good. The best thing about the pizza was the crust. The wings were nothing special." The highest point was the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive and took great care of us.  Thanks!" I will be back.................!" Lastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ "My brother had the Chipotle Chicken Pasta and I am going back for that myself soon. I stuck to basic pizza. Great lunch deal. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.00. They even have gluten free options available I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix."  as well as the meals and pizza. The coffee is never hot for some reason.  That would be about the only thing i could find wrong. They used to be a small little dive restaurant and have now moved several years ago to the location they are now. Food has always been good though. Sometimes dives are the best! It is family owned and run so  i think that is why they take such pride in the place. A very good thing. They have their own parking lot but  it's open until 10 PM on Sundays.  All those pizza restaurants that think that no one really NEEDS pizza on a Sunday can suck it.  Sometimes no other food will do.  And luckily for Phoenicians  and good food! I will definitely not just drive by this place anymore Kathy and Bob Vidican" The place was clean and the bathroom was pretty nice. I'll be back." "This pizza joint is one of the best in town!! We have been eating there for over a year and haven't gone wrong yet with our favorites. The wings are cooked perfectly with the meat falling off the bone with great options for homemade sauce. the hand tossed pizza is mouthwatering and our creation is always cooked to perfection --Canadian Bacon "OMG SO IT WAS HAPPY HOUR and I was meeting a hungry friend at the bar who wanted to EAT PIZZA. I hastily scoured yelp for a decent place to grab a pizza in Central Phoenix My neighbor brought one home for us to celebrate my belated birthday - Queen Margherita pizza was very good;  a basic pie with quality ingredients that shine through.  Well done. I think my girlfriend and I will be eating there with more frequency in the future and trying some of the other menu items.  I can walk there from my house  I believe he is the owners son. He is verrrry talented and I really enjoy listening to him sing. Nothing worse than listening to someone sing and you know they have no talent  but my girlfriend and I also split an order of some crazy spicy chicken pasta - it was absolutely awesome.  THAT ITEM was a 5-star meal.  Also I love that this place has a variety of vegan options. The calzone with soy cheese and soy sausage is delicious! The vegan pizza delight is also tasty. The owner and staff are great too. My only complaint is how much more the vegan calzone is compared to the regular ones. We ordered a handtossed vegan pizza with vegan cheese Great place to eat pizza if you are vegan!!  They offer vegan cheese (follow your heart) and vegan sausage (gardein).  Our server was very friendly and told us what products they used.  The pizza was amazing and delicious!  It's awesome that Phoenix has a place were vegetarians and vegans can go and get meat substitutes on a pie!  she had brought out the salad and then after i was finished eating my salad about 10 minutes later she comes out and says "" her is the bread for the caprese"". My friend ordered the penne pasta primavera and Tawny brought out the chicken parmigiana. When we brought it to her attention she questioned what my friend ordered as if he didnt know what he ordered and then after a few minutes came back and asked us to clarify. When she brought out the correct dish she apologized saying that a lot of the menu items start with ""P"". Who would of guessed at an italian restaurant. She didn't offer to take anything off the bill and made. no effort what so ever. Don't get me wrong I love this restaurant it has amazing food and Patricia the owner is a sweetheart. However Tawny has to go. She clearly has no idea what it means to be a server. I have served table and know exactly how to properly treat a customer." And...they are right across the street from my mechanic.  So I can get good food while I wait.  BONUS!" "I kinda don't want to review this place so that we can keep it as nice as it was on Friday. My husband and I got a night to ourselves so we tried this place out. It was delicious. But other than that allthough the pizza is pretty good  the delivery service is a rip off if you have half and half  its an extra $1.50 even if one half is just pepperoni # $3.00 delivery and then tax on top it makes the pizza pretty dam expensive   so i will not use them anymore I stopped eating my pizza to write this review. I'm so super bummed to see that PH has changed their vegan cheese from follow your heart to daiya.  Not to knock daiya because honestly it's a decent cheese but not on this type of pizza. I will probably not order again unless they switch back....Please bring back follow your heart! Follow Your Heart is back - yay!! And always great communication from the owner - thanks! wait staff are friendly & very vegan savvy.  decor is really 1990s' Italian The manager/ owner came by our table and many other tables to check and see how we liked the food and asked even if we had suggestions but we didn't ... everything was perfect. I will be back very soon."  including the veggies - they were so fresh! The pizza was not dripping in oil which was a plus! My girls got the soy calzone and we got a veggie pizza. My girls licked their plates clean and so did we! Customer service was wonderful and we only wish they had more of these places in Cali!"  not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!" auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ My husband went non-vegan calzone that was HUGE and plenty for 2 meals Will definitely go back to give the sandwiches a try when we're back in the area! Would definitely be interested in checking out the live music on the weekends."  but I assured him that I hadn't - it really was vegan sausage. The sauce was flavorful and the crust perfectly baked. The dough ball dessert was terrible (can't remember what it was called)  very affordable too.  I got the soy sausage on our pizza and it was amazing. I have been there twice and received excellent service.  I will definitely be returning and would recommend this place to anyone."   other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it." First time ordering from Pizza Heaven. I picked this place because of the yelp reviews. Perhaps their regular crust pizza is great but this was by far the worst gluten-free pizza I've ever had(no exaggeration). The crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard. I popped it into the oven to see if I could get e crust crispy but no luck. I'm so disappointed. I would visit this place again." in short: don't miss this place especially if you're veg!"  and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-" It's a great little neighborhood spot that we will continue to visit."  can be made as a gluten-free option! My friend and fellow yelper John M. had a very good dining experience at this restaurant and invited me to have dinner there with him so I can try it out - and I'm glad he did. It's a cozy little bistro with its own parking area - a plus for this part of 7th Avenue. The staff is very friendly and service was quick.  My order About 15 to 20 minutes. They are not miracle workers and it is pizza..."  especially if you ask for a little to-go container for the sauce as well so you can dip it. I have done this multiple times." "The Miko Miko and supreme are good.  ok overall. :-/ Did not like there chipotle sauce.  Not spicy at all We went here for the first time last night and absolutely loved it.  I am a vegan but my family is not so it was perfect for all of us to have options.  My vegan veggie sandwich was awesome.  The owner explained all of the vegan options and even gave us some delicious samples to try.  We will defiantly be back.  I can't wait to come back for the buffalo style veggie balls with vegan ranch.  :-) Definitely a nice place to have in my work and home area - and so much better than any of the chains!" Overall I would go back but would allot more time in the event of a mistake." this place is awesome! I ordered the vegan super veggie delight with soy sausage and it was incredible! I will definitely be going back "Decided to dine in during lunch hours. this place was picked mainly for the fact that they are vegan friendly.  The wings were cooked perfectly and sauce was mild sauce was ok. The Vegan delight pizza was really delicious. The cheese wasn't slimy and greasy like some vegan cheeses. They use Follow your heart cheese and it was very flavorful. topping were spot on. Soy sausage was surprisingly delicious Love love LOVE this place. Anytime I get a hankering for some pizza this is always my first choice! auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ Best vegan pizza ever. The vegan calzone is phenomenal also. Non-Vegan friends love it too. Overall it's a nice place and worth a try if you've never been or if you are on a vegan/vegetarian diet."  they're really good and at a great price.  They use disinfectant when cleaning tables which you rarely ever see at other places. The wait staff is always excellent  and drink - and for a small up charge you can get any toppings you want on your single slice. Most places in the area charge way more for pizza of this quality and you can't order just a single slice the way you like it. I'm a fan!"  nice waitstaff .. Another good pizza joint in Central Phoenix."  but this stuff is amazing. My complaint is that your only side dish option for the sub is french fries - carbs with carbs; a small salad would be appreciated. Also ask for the additional veggies on the subs "Just had carry out from these guys but DANG! If I had to rate Pizza in Phoenix Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars. "The best pizza places I have been to. Has a ""home"" like atmosphere rather then being at chain restaurant. Food is fantastic made to perfection. Service right when you walk in the door until you leave out the door." "We were excited to try this local pizza restaurant for dinner and ordered a sausage pizza on whole wheat. It was the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten. Too bad No hot sauce nor ranch :(" "So so food but sweet staff and low prices got the 4th star Bland crust. Bland cheese. Bland thin watery sauce. Even the sausage topping was meh. Do not recommend. How so many yelpers can give such glowing reviews... there are much better options . Great atmosphere. Great food. They have vegan menu. Ate the vegan pizza which was  amazingly tasty.  but I find it strange when bistros and theme restaurants do not play ""Italian"" music "My husband I love the great vegetarian/vegan options at Pizza Heaven.  The food is delicious  our waitress recommended it). It was all extremely delicious! The waitress was wonderful and the food was great. I believe the owner or manager was going around and talking with customers and making sure they were having a good time. I would gladly come here again Last night I had the Vegan Delight and added some tomatoes...It was really awesome!" That's all I had here. It was okay. Just had to give it a try and see if it was good. I don't  know if I would come here again. I normally like the pizza if the dough is good but I guess it just felt a bit too tough for my liking."  but the consistency and texture was great. The pizza I had was so so good. I will be back for sure!"  they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!" Good spot for cheap pizza and wings. Their lunch specials are the jam. Truly a pizza heaven. ;P "I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!" "Very fast service.  Our salad was brought out to us almost instantly after placing our order and the pizza followed shortly after.  We had one of there vegan pizzas and it was pretty good.  Our three year old is a pretty picky eater but she liked the cheese pizza.  For the price point So happy I gave this place I second chance!"   large portions. We'll definitely be back!" Let me know if you found a better place than Pizza Heaven." I rally love this place. Their calzones are huge and amazing and their Caprese salad is wonderful. I've ordered from them many times and eaten in their dining room a few times. It's a family run business that often has live music... Which is actually really good. I used to get more pizza for a little less money and now I get great reasonably priced pizza from a place feel good about patronizing. Order from here (and do your self a favor and try the meatball and sausage calzone)! I will not be returning here anytime soon."  Not even close to the worst. Nothing bad to say. I will go back for the wings:)"  and nice and hot. Pizza was Brick oven cooked and all of their meats and ingredients are fresh made in house. Check it out!"  I was disappointed with the calzone. The cheese was tasteless and the vegetables that I added in had hardly any flavor. It's difficult to find vegan pizza Will absolutely go back!!!"  full of spichach and covered in cheese.  I have to say the salad and wine were noyhing spectacular but functional.   The garlic toast was soft and buttery as well.  The service was adequate; perhaps a little slow even though it wasn't super busy.  The biggest complaint the live musician who was a good background music piano player but when he sang it was embarrassing.   He wad not good.  Would have been had he not sung at all.  Otherwise it was a terrific Friday night dinner out." We got a groupon and was not impressed. Overall rating 5 out of 10.  Food was ok. Waitress was bothered by us.  It was hot in there.  I did like their pasta alfredo Primavera.   The other thing I didn't like is they only have one bathroom for everyone.  hip live music and tasty Vegan options! Family-owned is a plus! Drive the old car as parking is very tight."  as long as it's not crowded. (Note: Lunch specials are no longer offered all day Such a waste of money. I will not be returning."  so I know what good pizza is I'm in love with this place! It has a hearty vegan menu (and of course non-vegan stuff). Such a treat. The vegan sausage sandwich was delish and the vegan cheesecake was just as good if not better than regular cheesecake. We went on a Friday and the owner's 20 something children were playing a live acoustic set. Such a great vibe this place has. So happy to have found it. Yay! Great pizza and quality live music. Two of my family members are vegan and ordered the meatless sausage and meatball sandwiches. I had a bite of both and they were delicious. The owner recommended her original handmade vegan cheesecake. It was excellent. It wasn't on the menu yet so you may have to ask for it. My husband and I fell in love w the vegan menu and I'm embarrassed to say we went there 4xs in one week. It is that good!!! We picked up the same pizza 2 nights later and then dined in and our waiter was phenomenal. Not like the lady who answers the phones. The vegan starter w veggies and bread was so Delish. I think it was called the Mediterranean Medley. The next time my husband picked up vegan sandwiches and the veggie ball sandwich was out of this world!!! Food is fantastic!!!! Now if they could just give the phone answerer an attitude adjustment  the delivery guy then said ""uh.. they told me to give you this"" and produced a drawing of a heart. Made us laugh  service and ombiance. The pastas are excellent. Try the Tequila with lime sauce or Chipotle sauce both with chicken. Treat your taste buds to excitement." Awesome!!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!!" "One of my favorite pizza places!! I've only ordered delivery but would dine in if I wasn't so lazy!!! ;) I love the wheat crust option!!! Zucchini sticks are delicious.. auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ  great food for a great price." "Homemade Italian food. Just like what I remember in Italy. If you want to escape and feel like you are away in Italy for a night  and it was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Oddly enough there was one super tiny slice that had no cheese on it lol.  I couldn't explain it.  Second time it was the margarita  the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites."  but he let me think about what to write and call back when I finally figured it out. My BF loved the pizza (and the note).  He sent me a pic of the pizzas and they looked absolutely amazing!! This place rocks and I've never had better customer service while ordering takeout.  I'm definitely stopping by next time I visit Phoenix." I gave it two stars because a co-worker liked her sandwich."  the best I have add thus far in Arizona in the 6 years I have lived here." The food is great! Atmosphere is awesome on Fridays because of live music! Definitely would recommend ! I love this place!!! The best pizza in Phoenix! And the meatballs are delicious made just right.  The service is great very personable. I had the chance to meet the owner. She is super sweet and all of her dishes come from her own family recipes... Amazing! Cute spot we found on yelp. Wings were great and crispy and spicy. Pizza was delicious not too thick. Don't order from these guys 30 minute before closing they'll take your order and money not deliver your food. I never received my pizza waited to 11pm nobody show up.... the spaghetti dinner is huge-en0ugh for 2 people. very tastey and flling. the calzones are also great-also enough for 2 peny and miss the ricotta/mozzarella calzonesople. i grew up in ny and miss the rocotta csalzones that are sols on the street corners. the service is also great at pizza heaven and i really like the hometown atmosphere Custom calzone was amazing... Great mozz sticks and chicken wings very good.  Got delivery to a local hotel. Fast fresh and awesome!!   Get a calzone w ricotta mozz parm salami and sausage. Unfknbelievable!! The side salad came with shriveled greens and cucumbers that look rotten." "Pizza Heaven is like the goldilocks of the Pizza food world. When you're looking for something juuuust right. The food is delicious I cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food." The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is clean!" Great service! David was wonderful and efficient. So kudos to you. Thanks for making my mothers birthday fun. The brownie was good. :) great GLUTEN FREE options-especially dealing with pasta. I'll go back for sure. Hopefully that wait isn't an everytime deal."  they have a robust take out business as well as a very busy dine in traffic.  The food and the service are always good. The atmosphere  feels a bit like home. What more could you asked for.  Good food Placed a carry out order through grub hub. I got the cajun chicken alfredo and bread sticks. The pasta came to my apartment still piping hot. The meal was good but the noodles were all stuck together which made it difficult to eat. Not sure if the sauce was just super thick or the noodles were over cooked. Either way I'd still eat there again. "Stopped in to load up on carbs before the Arizona Rock n Roll Marathon since there was a lucrative Groupon available. From the get-go service was a highlight. The owner Excellent food. Vegan dishes and live music on weekends. The staff and owner are always friendly. We love this place. "Great for delivery! And being able to order through Yelp makes PH an easy choice for the nights I don't want to cook at home. Have had the Works Pizza  and we decided to try a new spot.... so amazing. Food and service is on point. Totally recommend it."  this is a place you should try!!!!! The suicide sauce is delicious but do is every other sauce. I get these wings all the time just for that amazing wing sauce. I have tried the slices of pizza and wouldn't recommend them unfortunately. There is too much oregano or some green spice that ruins the taste of the pizza what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said.  when I go in. It reminds me of the bistro in the lady and the tramp. I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I will continue to come to this place as long as I live in phoenix.  it had a weird taste to it! No effort!  The  cheese on the pizza was thick and chewy!  I don't know why this place has 4 stars.  Maybe if you dine in this place delivers 4 star quality food.  Pizza Hell!"  I would like to suggest that you do something amusing and put bible quotes  so my dad called Pizza Heaven and told them he wanted to secretly pay for my dinner. I had no idea so when I go to the restaurant and was served a glass of their house chianti- which I'd recommend highly. I was given great service through out the entire meal and they were so great in making me feel special on my birthday! I did't even mention yet that they have GREAT vegan options! If you are a vegan/vegetarian you know how hard it is to go out to eat "This place has really delicious pizza. I had a sausage pizza from here last Sunday along with their angel bread sticks with marinara and I could've engulfed the whole thing. Their Hawaiian pizzas are also great "Still a fan of the pizza but the service Friday evening didn't impress me. They weren't very busy but the service was VERY slow. We were told the patio heater over the empty table we wanted was not operational We had delicious leftovers the next day.  I thought the staff was friendly  they offer a free drink. If I order a group of items that are on special they charge me less without me asking. They are just genuinely good people and it is for real. It is the kind of deep rooted pursuit of perfection that I have rarely encountered but always admire. Well done and appropriately named." I think I'll have to try it again with the thin crust and perhaps my 4-star will go to 5-star. Others ordered entrees from the menu and everyone was quiet when eating (always a good sign of good food when you're too busy eating to talk)."  they did not want to accommodate and finally said they would give us 50% off the next time we come. Well we are not sure if we will be returning. The wait was too long! Praying the food is good ..fingers crossed!"  more along the lines of a dominos style pizza then a fancy authentic italian pizza." I won't be back! Too many other fantastic independent restaurants in this city to waste my time at Pizza Heaven again!" Thanks again to Patricia and I will definitely be ordering again soon."  the less than expected experience for a locally owned business was disappointing but hopefully it was an outlier night for them (although I won't know as I don't plan to return)" "Ok...this place I really really liked. My husband had the jalapeno poppers and Hawaiian pizza and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Portions are hearty. Was it the BEST pizza and spaghetti  and vegetables--definitely a winner. Also make sure to check out their Meatball Parmigiana hot stuffed sandwich - hefty portion of meat  just ok..nothing special...We should have stayed at Oregano's down the street." auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ "ATTN ALL GLUTEN FREE AND/ OR VEGAN CONSUMERS: eat here and you won't be sorry. Best gluten free pizza I have tried to date so it to is well worth the price. My friend got a vegan pizza and was very happy with it as well. Plus gluten free pasta Great pizza. Wings are good the breadsticks are super great.     Service is quick and really nice people their.  The owner is funny  Pizza Heaven frequents the place everyday to make certain everything is to her high standards... And make sure you're there on Friday night to listen to the live music. Fantastic!!!!"  was told food would take 45-60mins but was a 3 hour wait. No manager to avaliable to speak with. Employees forgot to place order and all the could do was say sorry. Talk to several employees and no one seem to know what was going on. Worst experience ordering pizza."  even though the website seems to boast about their gluten free and vegan options. The waiter was polite and did remove the pasta from my bill which I greatly appreciate! My brother and his wife had the Chicken Parmesean which was NOT homemade. The chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture! The frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag. Anyway Used EAT24 take out. Great pizza. Wings are good.  We'll worth it. I will be using them over the hut in the future love love love this place! Thank Goodness for their Vegan menu!  only to find out I've got the vegan option! I definitely recommend the stuffed sandwiches. They're HUGE (I always have enough to save half for later) and only end up costing about $7-8. Plus  but the pizza was amazing!!!! We also ordered a brownie a la mode. It was okay. The brownie wasn't warm and it wasn't too much ice cream. If the brownie was better  was very polite and attended to my every need. He suggested the baked ziti with extra ricotta "I love Pizza Heaven! Been here to eat the restaurant a few times and had delivery once. I'm obsessed with their wings! Weird Great pizza place! We've been going here for years and I recommend the Bianca pizza with ricotta. The staff is very accommodating and the atmosphere is comfortable. Whether dining in or ordering to go it always good. Great food. Quaint and personable atmosphere. Tequila lime chicken was delicious. Alex was a fantastic server !  but tonight decided to dine-in at Pizza Heaven Bistro.  We were pleasantly surprised to have live music during our visit as well as an extremely attentive waiter.  Service was very quick and the owner even stopped by our table twice to see how we were doing.  The pizza was excellent as always  the owner has come to my table sits down and asks you how is everything. I've never had a complaint. The food is top notch (Tequila Lime Chicken Pasta) is my favorite dish. I come there at least once a week to get the 2 slice pizza special to go and have it for my lunch. Great Food  the Carnivori is a delicious meaty pizza and is my new favorite.  This is a very nice little place that I'll drive across town to enjoy again.  Had never been here before and only found it because we searched for pizza near the Rhythm Room.  I live in Gilbert but I'm def coming back.  The owner came and talked with us for a bit and she's passionate about all her home made food.  Thanks Patricia!" It could get a 5 star if the beer tap was colder and had a few more options. Think traditional Italian place that for some reason has awesome vegan pizza." If I am in the area again will certainly go again" The service was good and the staff was great.  We will definitely be back. The food is great to.  and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable. It wasn't a busy night and I was not being unreasonable. I will never be back here again." Oh and the jalapeo poppers were yummy too! Good job Pizza Heaven.  Ask for River too. He knows that menu in and out and will help make great suggestions."  the servers both River and Alex was very attentive. We will return!" Best vegan pizza place in Az!!I will be back Everything was good from A to Z.and I just love how next door they have unami serving vegan ice cream shake and all kind of goodies!! this is worth the drive and it will definitely be our spot when friend wants to eat pizza because they have both option vegan and non-vegan option they know what they are doing.5/5 for sure!:) go and try it you wont be disappointed!!! The pizza is delicious! Great spot to pick up lunch close to downtown. Sometimes they are a little understaffed and don't have enough people attending to customers dining in but there's no complaints about the food! P.S. Check the restaurant inspection report." Love this spot! They have the best vegan pizza. I am hooked! My husband had the regular pizza and he really liked his as well!  one regular. Both fantastic. What an amazing vegan selection. My dairy intolerant son was in ""heaven"".  Vegan meatballs were also a big hit."  or even a family outing. The food is always delicious especially when it comes to the calzones and pizza selections. I am not a vegetarian but I have dabbled in a few of Pizza Heaven's vegan items and I must say that they are pretty delicious. Another great food item at this place is their wings and breadsticks are incredible. When it comes to lunch the meal deals are affordable and filling. Not to mention the portions are Pizza Heaven are amazing. You definitely get more than what you pay for! Also the wait is never too long and the service is always friendly. The owners are always nice enough to always come out and talk to each costumer. I wish Yelp had more than five stars to rate Pizza Heaven!" We are always looking for new places to try on Groupon and Living Social and came across this fabulous place a few years back. It's a small family owned business and every dish tastes amazing and fresh! The prices and portions are great and everyone we have brought along with us each time we go is impressed. Looking forward to our next visit!  the food was fantastic. What was even better was their overall attitude and excitement in being part of a bunch of crazies all dressed up in what a 2 year old thinks is fancy attire. They were helpful in every way possible. This is our favorite pizza place for many reasons and we'll keep going back." Great place to go! We got 10 piece wings for an appetizer along with 5 breadsticks with a large BBQ chicken pizza. Everything here was exceptional. The space is perfect. A nice cozy place with great food. We paid $30.32 for everything. If a restaurant charges these higher price for gluten & soy options (of which I'll pay) - you'd better do them at a C level not D-.  4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options. Do yourself & customers a favor and take them off the menu." Their delivery was pretty quick to!"  uneven and he didn't even bother to open my beer for me). I arrived with 3 other people and we all received our food at different times. And about the food: I can't speak for the entire menu as I've only been there once but the vegan sandwich I ordered was just ok and the fries were terrible (frozen This place has always been a a place for good pizza and food and they care about their customers thanks for caring Pizza Heaven is absolutely delicious. My boyfriend insisted I write a review for it since I rave about it so much. I usually order a hand tossed vegetarian and I've never been let down. The flavor a of the sauce and cheese with the freshness of the crust make it beyond delicious and satisfying (very generous portions). I prefer Pizza Heaven to a lot of the popular pizza joints in metro Phoenix!  and wings! Sooooooo good and because the wings are baked they aren't all greasy or dry. They are great and taste way better. Yes a little pricier than the pizza chains  the service was excellent and the food was delicious and high quality. Angelica was our server and she was so sweet and helpful! The prices are more than reasonable for the authentic food you get. The atmosphere is very cozy and family like and they also have live music in the evening. I will definitely be returning to this Italian joint! Absolutely LOVE!!" Delicious pizza and excellent customer service. Pizza Heaven Bistro catered a large event for me and the quality and friendliness of staff exceeded my expectations. Will definitely be catering from them in the future. "Thin crust pizza was horrible. Waitress had a big nose ring through her septum...turned my stomach. Can't eat and look at that. She checked our table once. Horrible service. She was friendly "Came here because I was craving for wings and was not disappointed! Great customer service and wings. I like the honey bbq(I can't remember the exact name). There's also a hot version of it for those who are daring. The wings are big and meaty which was great! The only thing I didn't like was you can't do half and half on an order because the server said the owner doesn't like doing that. However  great food and great prices! David went above and beyond. He was running the entire place taking care of it all  and I loved every minute of it. The 4 dollar mimosa's were. Pretty good deal too!"  you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.   Very good food. Very affordable priced." One bad waitress can ruin a little business like this one. Word spreads. Fortunately  the last time I was there I found multiple hairs inside my vegan meatballs. I called the restaurant to inform them of what happened and the gentleman I spoke with told me the manager would contact me later  my fiance and I went in on 12/22. Unfortunately due to traffic (we drive 40 minutes to this side of town) we got here rather late and had to call in at 9:10pm instead of dining in. We explained the situation to the front desk who called Patricia who was unfortunately not in at this time We all brought home leftovers. Great lunch today." ***at a time when you should NOT believe every review you read on Yelp~ you CAN absolutely believe this one is real.  NO ONE paid me  and it's relatively inexpensive for all of the food your receive. I typically get the Baked Ziti which is so good and leaves me with plenty of leftovers. My boyfriend either gets a pizza or a hot sandwich and has never been unhappy. Love that we have such a great option for delivery in our neighborhood. We will have to stop by the actual restaurant sometime because it looks so cute!" "Placed a catering order for my office this week. Excellent service and amazing food!! Pizza Hands down THE BEST vegan pizza I've ever had. Everything I've ate from the vegan menu has been great. I am vegan but have lots of non vegan friends. This is the place to go so that everyone is happy! The owner went to great lengths to make it great for vegans and meat eaters alike!! My fav is the vegan baked ziti with soy sausage!! All the pizzas are also excellent! Vegan cheese cake or angel bite are great for dessert!  affordable food that meets all our needs and isn't just salad. My only complaint is they took the ravioli off the menu  the quality of the food doesn't make up for the lack of good customer service so we won't be returning again."  service and cheerful staff .I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great meal . The outdoor setting is very peaceful considering its right by all of the traffic. Totally worth it !" I'm sincerely hoping this is a one-time issue because we have enjoyed their pizza in the past."  I didn't have to order garden salad! My family enjoyed the non vegan pizza too!"  and stick to carry out instead of dining in. Very disappointed that today was the opposite experience that I had from the first time." "So I have been wanting to try this place for months and unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed.  The pizza was alright All in all great customer service and awesome wings!" Amazing food and drinks great service Waitresses are so sweet love the two girls working tonight  will definitely be back best pizza in town!! The calzones are to die for huge and yummy! Like this place. Started going a few months back re: we had a groupon. Have been back probably 6 times since. The pizza is good and so are the wings. Love the Peroni on draft and the live music on Friday nights. I appreciate owners who own their business in more ways than one. She definitely did and I'm satisfied with calling our previous experience with Pizza Heaven a ""one off."""  but lately I haven't liked it as much.  I suggest asking for extra sauce on this pizza (their sauce is good).  I think my new favorite pizza is the BBQ chicken pizza.  It has a good taste and has nice big hunks of chicken on it.  I have not tried their other menu items yet.  Pizza Heaven is the only pizza place I keep coming back to.  They were also able to take care of my order of 4 pizzas in a timely manner."  hey sell pizza by the slice and is centralized."  so we ordered a pizza and it arrived about 40 minutes later. I love the large amount of toppings and thickness in the crust Try a slice! I'm sure their variety of pizza will have your attention!"  and cheesecake and it was all amazing! It was a really cute place and the staff was super friendly. Love this place!"   they were thoroughly enjoyed.  I then proceeded to attempt my 18 min ride home with the pizza riding in the passengers side staring at me but I broke down and had a slice on the way home.  I just couldn't resist.  As soon as I got home I ate 4 more slices.  I'm stuffed and am a happy camper. But I will have my running shoes on in the morning.   Would highly suggest to amy vegan/non vegan customer.  Customer service was cool too. I'd put bible scriptures on the boxes too. Heavenly idea ." 2nd problem. Ordered a WORKS PIZZA. It was delivered with less items than usual. Called and another pizza was delivered but the rest of our meal had to be re-heated.               3rd problem.      ordered a Greek salad. it was delivered w/the box half empty. called and another salad was delivered.  My family started    their dinner before I received my salad.    seems care is not taken with delivery orders."  subs and pizzas. The owner makes some of the appetizers from scratch as well as the vegan cheese cake. Amazing. She did her research and got follow your heart brand cheese which if you're a vegan you know daiya cheese just doesn't cut it. They put their effort into accommodating for many food preferences." apologizing for the confusion and explaining what happened. I just thought that was really nice and a great indicator for great customer service."  is on her game and will take good care of you." I'm quite annoyed that I wasted $50 for dinner tonight.  My daughter and I always try to go to local places and want to try new places when possible.  Bad customer service + bad food = FAIL!"  food was good. Service great. Love the sloppy wings and pizza was ok. Mozz sticks  but pretty loud traffic as it was right on 7th street. Service was very good and friendly. It was 5:00 on a Friday "Good place to grab lunch when I want a slice of pizza I love this place! All through high school I would come here on Friday afternoons. They have this amazing deal with two slices and a drink for something like $5. It's amazing! The pizza comes out hot and fresh and the staff always comes and chats with us for a while too! A large group of teen boys is not welcome with such open arms to many places but pizza heaven will always be my pizza home  salads are good--really haven't ordered anything that's been a disappointment yet. They also have a good reasonably priced lunch slice special. Definitely worth stopping by if you're craving a slice and in the area."  which is ridiculously fast. Their pizza is amazing. Their salads are also amazing. Their wings are  and red peppers in a great balsamic vinegar and olive oil concoction. Sarah had the penne la greca with shrimp. She is giving it two thumbs up. I absolutely loved the spaghetti. Perfect pasta "Best vegan pizza in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area hands down.  You have to try the Veggie Balls.  They don't cut corners on ingredients "This place is a good little pizza joint. My husband and I are both vegan and I love that have an entire vegan section on their menu. It's a place we can share with all of friends and family; where all are happy. The vegan Agave BBQ pizza is my favorite and the veggie balls are pretty darn good "We've been loving this place for years.  Best pizza. Best Italian dishes.  Even the vegans will love this place as there is a dedicated section on the menu.  All things considered  as they didn't really check on how we were doing. Also had to put our drinks at the very end of the table for more water and even had to ask for our check at the end. In the end I have only picked up a to-go order once from Pizza Heaven ( I am anxious to return again).  We purchased two lasagna orders for carry-out.  They were delicious and I am picky about lasagna.   They stayed nice an hot til I got home and plated them.  I plan on going back as soon as I can and order the lasagna again and hopefully dine in next time. "I would never have stopped in or tried this Pizzeria if it hadn't been for a Living Social offer. I'm happy I purchased the offer after our first try. Pizza and wings were amazing. Second time around wasn't quite as impressive as the first. The joint has a private party out on the front patio and the service inside of the restaurant suffered a bit. Various tables remained dirty for quite some time. Our pizza didn't have quite as much sauce and not enough Pepperoni. Overall The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  Great atmosphere.  Delicious pizza.  And a tv.  What more could you want out of a pizza place?" "I like the lunch special and that this place isn't that crowded. I can stop in here and check email while having lunch with no problems. The TV usually has a game on to watch as well. The pizza is pretty good. The dining area is a little dark Get the lasagna.  Kicks ass!  One order is good for two normal size people.  if I ever did Pizza Heaven Bistro would be a place I'd come back to."  tight shopping area on N 16th Street."  Robert acknowledges you as soon as you walk in the door.. Orders are always correct too" Worst service and pizza!!!  Just ordered Chicken BBQ and I got something totally not Chicken BBQ.  So I called them to let them know we got the wrong pizza and they keep hanging up on me.  I didn't even get to tell them.  I just said I got the wrong pizza and they keep telling me to hold then hangs up.  My favorite pizza is Pizza Hut but not this location for sure.  If I can give -star I would. Had a great example of good customer service tonight with Brian! Also the pizza was delicious but customer service makes all the difference. "This is the location that delivers to my home. I have ordered several times and gotten great service. I only had a problem once and it was made right asap. If you haven't ordered from PH lately "Interesting that incorrectly making an order I'd already paid for that looked inedible I was asked only if I wanted credit or to wait for 20 min not free delivery or a refund as I'm only 2min away. Find the other pizza joints in the area Awesome hot cookie and the brownie is a triple chocolate overload madness of chocolate" "pretty good pizza place... i get take out from here alot... the ""pies"" are large and you can get anything on them... the salads are also good... i have never eaten in the restaurant but it is normally busy when i am there...  kinda expensive for pizza but i have not found a place i like better (la grande does not count!)" When I go back to visit in Phoenix a stop at NYPD is always on the agenda." Also high on the list are the garlic and cheesy knots.  My only complaints are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and that the ziti sauce can be a bit peppery sometimes."  perfect for shoving pizza down your throat."  but I have not ordered one yet do to the 20-30 minute prep time. The prices are reasonably cheap  but apparently the fact that they import their water from Brooklyn is a big deal.  Kinda pretentious if you ask me yummy yum yummy pizza! I have been going here for years. Great place to  sit and gab with the girls around a hot pie and a cold pitcher. Great ambiance and very relaxed. Great pizza and desert!! Totally reminds me of getting a slice in NYC.  It's even better cold the next morning!" I give it my 2nd highest 'sausage and pepperoni' rating Great pizza - great calazone's - don't care for the garlic cheese knots. I have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed. NYPD is excellent for pizza This is anything but NY pizza...average at best and way to expensive!....If you want REAL NY piazza got to Bounos in Mesa (gautalupe & dobson)..It may be a hole in the wall but has the BEST piazza in the valley...take it from a person who grew up on NY piazza! Tell them Jenny from the block sent you." My manager says ""MMMMMMMMMM"""  I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York! By the way did I mention I don't like police. Except a friend of mine who just graduated the academy. Congratulations! Now keep me safe from other police." It's my favorite.  Truly."  it definitely would have been a 4 star experience.  I'll definitely go back  I probably wouldn't go back...it just really wasn't all that impressive." i tend to be pretty picky about pizza and wasn't expecting much from this place. so i was shocked how good the pizza was here! would go back for sure! great service!!!!!!!!!!!!  along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!"  and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet! I used to order from a Chinese delivery place solely because they gave you little trinkets with your order  and I'm skeptical that any pizza served by the slice and individually topped can be palatable. Ok I admit I'm wrong! I'm stuck up about these things. NYPD has great pizza I can walk in order two slices however I want them I am giving this place 5 stars but as a disclaimer I've only had their pizza. My fiancee and I have gotten pizza from this location a couple of times and every time it's hot and Delicious. This location is very convenient for pickup or they have a patio if you're feeling social. We usually get the Vinny's favorite where you can choose up to 5 different toppings. We get a new combination of toppings each time and are never disappointed. I would highly recommend trying ricotta cheese and eggplant on your pizza. We will be back for sure!  but anything I eat usually ends up being messy and in my book: messy=good. I'm a fan!"  I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."  but only if I were in the area." "Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall Not a well known location so its not as busy as some NYPDs I've been to. Just as good as the others though. Probably the fastest I've ever gotten my Calzone. I'd definitely go again. "Decent pizza for a chain.  We ordered a side of meatballs which were just ok.  There was too much bread crumbs and not enough spices.  We ordered the ""thin crust"" which isn't what you normally expect.  The ""thin crust"" was really just the standard pizza crust.  Would come back but definitely not very memorable."  so order a small if it's just for one person. Wings are very tasty. I'd recommend it."  but the food is good!  There is an option for a 5 topping pizza for $17.00.  Their beer selection is average  even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews "Pretty good chain pizza.  Service was good too once I got the waitresses attention.  I must say that there is nothing special about this particular restaurant/location.  I had a small side salad with vinagrette dressing.  Very tasty.  Followed by the ""Meateaters"" pizza for one (10"").  The pizza was really just average.  Nothing to write home about.  And they're not cheap by any means." Yummy food and nice guys making it "1st time at NYPD last night. Our son has been talking about it and my husband loves NY style Pizza so we went. They welcomed us like we were the most important customers. Courteous (Oh and their garlic knots are ridiculous too)" First time eating here and they were very busy. The service was good not fast and not slow. Really good flavorful pizza not a bad price  but if you catch a lunch special or something its not too bad. Ive been coming to this place for years and its good every time." Possibly better than actual New York pizza  well worth it. My brother just had his wisdom teeth pulled two days ago and has been eating oatmeal and pudding for these past two days. I holla lets do some NYPD for lunch! my brother jumps up with this smile on his face "Have been here several times for many years...Just never wrote a review...Had a craving for a pizza with sausage & pepperoni; and NYPD Pizza just fufilled that craving...Love the pizza  but this past visit wasn't the best for me." great pizza i always get the brooklyn and am satisfied everytime. the only thing i think they can work on is their delivery times maybe. not sure why but it takes them a minimum of an hour to get the pizza to my apt even though i live only a couple blocks away.  and subway-esque signage. Only thing I haven't liked here is the lemonade  I can see myself coming back here as a customer.  Keep up the good work NYPD!"  great staff and i can bring my dog."  they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza  I will definitely head back again. I hear they deliver too!" I love this Pizza place!!!!!I had the white pizza and it is amazing!!!The only set back is its kinda pricey compared to other pizza joints but it is worth it for the quality of the pizza!!!  this is true NYC style pizza.  I had two slices of the cheese for lunch today  the waitresses were very friendly and welcoming. I would go back again in a heartbeat  there was another group like ours  warming up that pizza in the oven gave it that slight extra crunch that made it really good "Great pizza mainly because the crust is so good.  Get clam and onion Good Fast chain of pizza places Not great not anything special but really its hard to find good pizza in the valley still on the hunt.  I don't think a chain place is going to make the cut. "I wish they had a location closer to me! I've always done the take out but now I guess they deliver too! The pizza is crisp and has the perfect amount of cheese. I like that they have updated their website. They have a 10"" pizza which is great for a night in alone. Prices are spot on. Staff friendly." A staple for pizza night or if you want a good Italian dinner at home without slaving over it for hours. The cheesecake was actually the best part of it; next time  gargonzola and pepperoni. Gargonzola is not listed as an addtl topping but you may order it. That combination is so delicious." "We stopped in late on a Friday night. We were seated immediately and our drink order taken. Our server was friendly and we never had to ask for drink refills and she stopped by regularly to check on us &  Even though they were closing in an hour You have got to love NYPD in my opinion it is far and away the closest thing in the valley to be sitting in the Bronx..... The bombers were even on the TV for lunch...... And the fact that Josh (mgr) gave me a new T-shirt doesn't hurt..... But seriously if you haven't ever been to an NYPD go... their all great but this one is by far my favorite..... Til next time  and great fast and friendly service..."  but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!"  just the way we like em! The pizza was tasty! The crust was nice and crispy. We will definitely try this place again." I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a 10-inch pizza with breaded eggplant and artichokes.  It was soooo good!  This pizza definitely reminded me of home!  Shoutout to my Yelp friend Ebony W.  It was her check-in that sparked my curiosity to try this spot :)  Ooh and they have locations throughout the valley.  I will have to try the Scottsdale location next! Pizza is very good!  Patio is nice and well shaded.  They will allow pets on the patio if well behaved!  he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.   When I did show up and had a beer with friends while waiting he had the audacity to make a comment that if our intoxication became a problem he would have to ask us to leave."  right?  My girlfriend and I are often disappointed each time we try a new place that doesn't quite live up to NYPD Second try ordering online. Ordered this time despite the difficulty communicating with everyone who answered the phone. $22 before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza. Hope it's good. Fingers crossed. Will update when food arrives. The server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience." "NYPD pizza is overall good pizza in Phoenix. I have been to several of the locations and they are fairly consistent. They have pizza by the slice TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ  or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good." Well I guess you can't have it all though so I will just stick with what I have found at NYPD."  one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely I have never been disappointed in an NYPD Pizza and will always go back for a slice or two!" "I was contacted by NYPD management who took the time to assist in resolving my previous issues.  It's still a bit pricey  atmosphere and food!  I recommend the Sicilian (thicker crust)" "Love this place! We first discovered it in TN and thought it was only over there. Luckily it's all over the valley I recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!" Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.  but the food quality seemed to be slipping. Something different was off with each experience. It eventualy got to a point where we questioned why we spent the extra money on quality that was getting to be less than ideal. We reserved ourselves to finding another pizza joint in the neighborhood. Tried a few other places  I order from them all the time. Quick delivery. Decent prices. And DELICIOUS food. You HAVE to try the garlic knots. Girls who take your orders are always very nice." Really disappointing." Be aware that it takes about 30 minutes to get your pizza. They don't cut corners here. Get some appetizers if you can't wait that long. Salad is a good choice. I personally don't want the cheesy  I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion Needless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends."  and the pizza is consistently good.   Don't waste your time with other pizza delivery.  NYPD really is the best around Biltmore/Arcadia for delivered pizza."  the service was great and quick. This was my first time eating here and its great pizza with great ranch dressing. We had pepperoni and cheese slices with a salad. The salad was big enough to share so that was nice. I would definitely order from here and get delivery or just go and eat here again. They had some renovations going on during our trip there but it was still really clean and nice inside."  I have a reference point.  I love the oil that drips down in the middle of the pizza when it's folded...Yummmmmm! That's surely the money maker and that's why I keep coming back. Service is always on point  yet elegant.  The customer service was fantastic - from the hostess to the waitress and the food was terrific.  I couldn't have been more pleased with how everything looked and the entire dining experience.  We will definitely remain loyal patrons.  Nice job NYPD!" I'm dreaming of my next visit!" P.s.  The two gentlemen that sat down behind us were legit old school Italian guys ON CAMELBACK! Speaking Italian throughout dinner.   Not a bad endorsement right there!"  one of my regular spots. They definitely go out of their way to please you.  Thank you"  but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?"  but only through delivery." Overall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis  2 stars. They forgot my order which really grinds my gears. The price is a solid 4 stars too. For airport food I didn't have to take out a loans to get a slice and a water. It was just $6 and change. If you're in Terminal 4 in the B gate area "Came here on a vacation and have never tasted a better pizza. Service was absolutely incredible. A bit pricey The hubby and I are currently in the process of moving to Phoenix so trying to find some of the things that we love back home pizzas one of them we are both in the service industry husband is a restaurant manager we both believe that good service is just as important as good food. NYPD pizza has both I looked at a few other pizza restaurants before ordering from here. The other places got good food marks but bad service reviews we are currently staying in a hotel in unfamiliar with the area in the process of ordering online by the way very convenient and easy I called the restaurant to ask a question about an item Leo answered the phone very friendly great service after placing my order within a few minutes the manager from the restaurant called me because he was unsure about an ad on that I had and wanted to confirm he had it correct. to me that goes above and beyond instead of just assuming you called me to check it out the food was delivered within the 60 minute time frame I was given the driver was very friendly and most importantly had change we ordered pizza salad zucchini sticks and cannolis all in all after tip $42 yes a little pricey but great service and amazing food. you definitely get what you pay for here very much pleased and looking forward to ordering again thank you in YPD pizza for a great experience in Phoenix  I enjoyed the experience and will eat there again." I ordered delivery from here and it was delicious! The pizza came on time and the delivery man was very professional. He opened the box and showed me the pizza before I accepted it. The pizza crust was crispy and the sauce was delicious. I added fresh basil to the pizza and it was fresh and delicious! We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!" Great food and fast delivery service. Prices are decent. There's not Mich more to write about. Two thumbs up! Very friendly staff! Customer service is above and beyond! And of course the pizza is fantastic! Best in Phoenix!! Will definitely go back!!  but the service and management is what really impressed me. I had one of those rare experiences where the staff went over the top and created an experience we will not forget. Very friendly greeting and excellent service. When the pizza was delivered we asked for Tabasco sauce. The waiter said he would check. The waiter came back and informed us they were out of Tabasco  and I have no doubt he'll make it soon - great personality and motived to boot.  Wish I had caught his name. I'll make sure to do so during our next visit." We won't be coming back."  after having a salad & the penne pasta!! We had Alicia as a server and she was very nice & attentive!! When we said it was our first time there & we were from CA "Best replication if nyc pizza in phoenix hands down.  Greasy Not sure of the couple of negative reviews on here but apparently they have nothing better to do than whine. Speaking of  really nice atmosphere and the staff is great.  We'll definitely be back." Great tasting pizza with huge slices.  I'll pass on the pasta.  I've been here on the two separate occasions.  First time had the Wall Street Pizza based on suggestion from staff.  Staff is friendly and appreciative.  Pizza was delicious and slices were huge.  Didn't wait long either.  Second visit had a pasta dish with penne and meatballs.  Lots of cheese but the sauce and meatballs lacked flavor.  They also have fast carry out. I finally found my ZA takeout place.  Score!!  very slow. There are more employees than customers while we were there "Probably the best pizza and wings in the city.  Definitely worth the trip and while it's a little pricier if your a dominoes fan  ordered after waiting to be seated and got their food before us. I guess if you seat yourself and put your own order in they no longer consider you a good customer or something because it sure felt like no body cared about our experience. Only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress.  Bad experience service wise but its what we have grown accustomed to at this location. Take my advice and just order delivery." "What has happened to this place??  New management?  I came on here to see if there are any other disappointed customers recently.  My office has ordered from here numerous times for years. We know it takes over an hour for delivery so that is why we call in shortly after they open.  Last time we ordered it took 2.5 hrs for our food. They gave us a 50% discount. We were never gonna order again.  However "Pretty great pizza but when I pay for double pepperoni on a pizza that feeds ""2-3"" and it runs me about $20..I'd love to see more than 2 pepperonis per slice." The service is good. There was no wait and the food came out pretty fast." I ordered a sausage pizza. It was delivered on time . However the pizza was cold and  I struggled on eat the dough even with a knife.  Very disappointed.  We order from them quite frequently Good pizza.  Stopped here for takeout with friends.  Had a salad which was very fresh and delicious.  Pizza was tasty and hot upon pick up.  A little out of the way for a regular pizza for us but definitely a good place to go for a pie!  and our waitress Casey was very sweet and outgoing. I highly recommend this location. Will definitely be coming back soon!" "It was a good date night place to try but it was ""talked up"" too much in ads and the radio. It is moderately priced for mediocre food. Pizza is good if you are wanting something different than the normal delivery. We are hoping a different location will be better and match the reviews we heard." Do you really think this is going the be the best pizza?  Um No but it is better than the crap you order from Papa John's  I just had hope. I didn't take them up on their offer to rectify the issues  I use to frequent their chandler location. Make sure to order their large artichoke dip.. I always order their veggie pizza. They can use a little more cheese on the pizza. Service is good  spicy but not umbearable. Pizza just the way i liked it.  Thanks for a very pleasant evening." This is our go-to place for great food and great service.  Their pizza and gluten-free pizzas are the best in town.  The Italian wedding soup and their seasonal salads are delicious.  Thank you Samson for providing excellent service on our most recent visit.  We'll be back soon!  spent most of my life in NY/NJ  with the exception of using cornmeal and the pie's being smaller then what you would get in NY and slightly more expensive "Definitely one of the best restaurants in Phoenix with regard to serving a true New York style pizza.   Friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.  Manager Brittany handled very professionally a small  faux - pas with my order "I love this little joint! It is a very cozy atmosphere and the food is great. I always get a calzone "Very Good! Had the Margherita pizza and salad. Pizza was great we had the best service from ashly!!!!! best service we've had in a long long time" NYPD Pizza was way better our second time around. I would definitely recommend going and would go again. Just tried to order. Unfortuatly the highly populated area of 85251 is out of the deliver radius of ANY location this restaurant has to offer. Just plain old NY style pizza and hot wings are very good.  I don't care for anything else on the menu so stick to these two things.  The Italian dishes are not good at all! I ordered a 5 large pizzas two separate occasions and was told it would be 90 mins for delivery. Both times the pizza was delivered not before the meeting intended for Every time I've ever been here for lunch or with a friend the service has been timely and friendly. I've order simple slices to go and full pizzas. The mix drinks are yum! I usually try whatever drink my server recommends and I'm never disappointed. Love the remodel and booths that have been put in.  you can get a slice and salad to go in under 5 minutes! Delish!"  and a bowl of spaghetti  and meatballs . The pizza was phenomenal !! It's one of my new favs  my daughter and bf loved their spaghetti and meatballs . They both raved about the marinara sauce . If your in central Phoenix and looking for some Italian food be sure to check out NYPD  pizza" One of my favorite pizza spots. I don't dine in often (when we did the service was meh). Carryout is the way to go! Delicious pizza without the annoyance of inattentive staff.  loved the ziti. My wife returned the pasta and got a slice of pizza. The waitress/hostess was very nice. The manager came over and removed the pasta from the check.  For desert we had the cheesecake and some cannoli. Again  which they did. I did or said nothing wrong. There are too many Pizza shops in this town for them to think that they can treat people depending on how they feel. I will never give these people my business and will recommend the same to the people that I know. I have never written a review but this prompted me to because a patron should be treated with respect."  so I immediately call.  The manager said he would refund the card we paid with for the cost of the food forgotten. (chicken on a salad).  So.....not make it right and bring the chicken?  So now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch?  But **free** iceberg lettuce.  I asked ""that's what we do?""  And yes  staff was awkward and weird. NOT TRUE NEW YORK PIZZA. This is a chain of restaurants so that should say something. This place sucks save your money and go to Ray's pizza or Isa Pizza or even Barrows pizza ." Definitely would recommend to my friends!"  but it's not poor enough to override the strengths of the establishment. Pros vs cons . . . pros win!" The atmosphere is very chill and New York like. Service was excellent and I am definitely going back." I love the food here. It is delicious and really hits the spot when your craving some good pizza. I had never Sat down to eat. Always take out. But I decided to bring my daughter in and sit down and have dinner with her (she is 6)  As always the food was great. Our waitress fabien was fantastic! So accommodating! She was happy and so helpful. I will be back to dine in again with service like that. Well done! TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ I went and had dinner in the restaurant! Amazing food! excellent pizza and great environment. New York style pizza and huge! No complaints and will eat here again The best Penne with Saysage.  Tory manager is awesome and Alicia the server fr Alaska is amazing! Their pizza is fantastic!  The service is solicitous and good.  They have a cute outside area plus abar where you can eat as a single as I often do.  The wings and salads are great tho i have received some wilted greens...hence the 4 star rating. Awesome. Food was great. Atmosphere was great. Our server Christian was amazing too. Will be for sure coming back to this place again.... Crispy margherita pizza. Very friendly staff. Way better than Oregano's! Too full to try the dessert but we'll try again next time. I pass 20 pizza places on my way here and never think of stopping. Delicious. Got a pizza for delivery tonight after a 90 minute wait our pizza was totally dried out.  We specified double sauce but it was like minus sauce.  When I called to let them know I was only given the choice to take another pizza or a free one next time.  Horrible choice since it was so bad I really just don't want one. The second one arrives and well this one has sauce that's for sure - but wait where are the toppings? It's like they forgot them now. We put it in the trash - called and asked Tory for money back and he said the best he could do is try another night. I WANT MY MONEY BACK - you ruined pizza night!" The customer service team at the Resturant was apologetic and offered a refund.  Now a satisfied consumer!  Thanks I'm so happy to have a great pizza place like this nearby and I plan to return in the future."  the best way to describe it is that It's like a cheaper knock off version of oreganos. Pizza we ordered well done because the menu told us to and it still came out soggy and the chopped salad was 98% just lettuce.  The boneless wings we ordered were good at least." good pizza but how the hell is your air going to break in the peak of summer you guys messed up there..how the hell am I suppose to enjoy my pizza if imy sweating a lot and then the food took an hour to come out..smh  they try to get me to pay at the store. The only way to pay when doing an online order is paying immediately. I don't know why they ask customers to pay at the store Side note to management..... our group (all ladies) did stop going to your restaurant for a brief time due to the homeless/disadvantaged people approaching us and begging for money every time we were in the parking lot.  It appears this unfortunate situation has been rectified as we saw security patrolling the lot and not a single person approached us for $$."  I placed my order then sat down across the way so they could see where I sat.  While waiting for my order the same cashier came up to me asking what I was doing in the restaurant sitting at a table. I told her ""I ordered a pizza from you a few minutes ago and waiting to eat it here"".  Eventually it was brought out to me in a ""to go"" box Ice Cold zucchini appetizer. Been here before it was good. But this ruined it for me. Makes me think none of it is fresh. Our server Natalie was great and apologized more than once and also took care of it. Limoncello cake it's really good.  zero water and zero waitress. Sad thing no one else was in the place except for one guy sitting at the bar drinking. Food maybe good but service sucks. Would not be coming here ever again."  delicious meal. The service is always excellent and friendly. The pizza is just the way I like it - thick  good service....a great spot for NY Pizza. Also they have a great selection of slices at lunch time. I recommend this spot for sure!"  was quick and excellent!!  Will definitely order again next time I'm in town!!" Four Stars. will return."  ABOUT IT   BECAUSE ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS TOLD ME  THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT US. It was only 3 ppl at the bar drinking and only 4 of us eating maybe next time the kitchen staff needs to be a lil bit faster and keep your comments to your self. Food was really GOOD!! BUT KITCHEN SLOW"  horrible gluten free pizza. I don't want to judge this place too harshly on something that's not what the restaurant is all about but it's important for people seeking gluten free pizza to know. If I were them I wouldn't even carry this product at all. The dough is so flat and has a really weird after taste. Most places seem to use the same frozen rounds and they just don't cut it. I know GF will never replace pizza and there is only so much you can do but I really challenge this place to come up with a mix and bake fresh made pies. If I can do it in my home anyone can do it. The demand for GF alternatives is only growing and if you can have an edge on something like that it would set you apart from others. Maybe the owners should just try the GF crust and see what I mean. For having such amazing regular pizza they should at least try to put out a better quality product." This is based on the customer service of the location.  I have been to this location many times for pickup.  I received a burnt pizza and was told I would receive a discount on a future order.  When I went to redeem the next order I was told nothing but excuses as to why there would be no discount. Good work management team you saved the company $10.00. "Just moved here and I gotta tell you I was very disappointed in this place I ordered Margareta pizza I have been eating at NYPD for some time and it is always great.  The Food is wonderful and the staff is amazing.  For some time now a young man named Adem has been my server and is wonderful.  I eat most of my meals out and I can tell you he is the best.  Adem knows the menu inside and out so he can help with offering up vegetarian or Vegan items.  He greets you as you enter and is so fast at assisting you with a drink and a menu.  He checks back often and is so attentive that he knows just the right time to bring over the check.  Adem is a huge asset to NYPD.  I wanted to make sure someone knows how great he is.  I managed domestic and international customer service for a large international company for 37 years and have now retired.  If I was still working I would steal Adem away as his skills would be valued at any company.  Thanks Adem for always being the best....Ray "NYPD pizza was always my all time favorite pizza since it first started. I order their food for about a few years now and I can say that their pizzas especially are one of the best in the country in my opinion. That's just how good their food is too me. Prices are a little high but that doesn't stop me from ordering there weekly. You guys should really try their options they provide. You will not regret it "My favorite place in the valley for Calzones the size of your head! Their water filtration system Ph balances the water to be the same as New York City so the dough rises and tastes great. Finish off with their giant cookie and ice cream and walk away full 4. Keep the food portions consistent" "NYPD Pizza on Camelback is a bit out if my way but the Roast Beef sub is to die for! One of my clients brought me one of the subs. Now I go out of my way to order the number 3 on the menu. It's a roast beef sub and it's amazing! The service is  great "Last night we decided to get our pizza delivered instead of picking it up (normally we pick it up to make sure everything is right and all there) and I have to say the lady that delivered our pizzas was amazing. She was so sweet and thouggtful. She brought us ranch even though we didn't ask for them and lots of napkins and was just all around friendly. I did not catch her name but she had really bright red hair A little disappointed today..."  Ryan and of course our most favorite waitress in the world FABIENNE!! these people treat us like family and are always happy to see us come in! You cannot receive better customer service here than with them and of course the whole crew. They always make sure that everyone who comes in are all catered too!! They have many regulars/usuals and I can see why! Great place to eat! Our favorite food aside the pizza are the honey hot traditional wings they are the bomb.com! You must try Great desserts!! The service is usually slow but the food is on point. I usually get a calzone and finish it off with one of their amazing desserts especially the zippolies We sat and we're talking among ourselves. Our waitress came up and ask how we were doing. She took our order. She was very friendly.  I didn't think much of it. We ate and left.  As my husband went through  his battle  all he wanted was NYPD pizza. I promised him pizza when he was able to eat it. A month went by and we returned.  We got the same waitress. Again she was kind . I asked her for her name. Fabienne  she said but likes to go by Fabbi. We went back and she was not there but we stood anyway. The server that day was blah. We were going grocery shopping one day and I went in to see if she was there.  By chance she was so we decided  to stay. The day Fabbi no longer works there is the day we stop going. She is a great fabulous  person "Simple as this..... If you want some kick ass pizza and some bomb ass boneless wings that will make you rethink the best wings you've had  a PHX police officer was ambushed and died in the line of duty. I asked for the manager and told him we'd like to leave enough $ to cover his ticket along with gratuity. INSTEAD OF TAKING MY $  it would be excellent. Really disappointed!" "I just wanted to say thank you NYPD pizza for not only having great pizza but also having such a friendly and polite driver. She left us a thank you note on our Knotts with her name We would go back. I would recommend."  because the weather is hot Hot HOT! I received my salad and chicken wings 8 mins after I ordered! The lasagna came 10 mins later. Food was super good! I'm definitely coming back!!!"  and soda) all which was very good. They were kind enough to provide plates and plastic ware since we were at a hotel which I thought was convenient. Our lookout ended up falling asleep in the room while the rest of us went to the pool Ordered  pizza for delivery.  They got the address  wrong but still  got the pizza here 15 minutes  early. . They help set the order up and brought all utensils.  The pizza was good . Good  lend of cheese and meat. They have a great Hawaiian  pizza. We were stuck for something to grab to eat. Nothing marks this place out: yet another pizza place in yet another strip mall. But the pizza was actually quite good. the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.  a good couple slices of pie.  I'm likely to go back!" Great pizza and wings...ok price  but the pizza was extremely bland.  The wings weren't very tasty either and the fried zucchini/mozzarella was equally as bland.  I would not go so far as to say I would recommend them to a friend."  I go to Frank's pizza and demand my money back. I witnessed the delivery guy return and noted he was not carrying my order. Hmmm. So on top of really poor service I had been lied to as well. While I was waiting there (both times)  i watched a really incompetent staff handling the food with bare hands  they don't have a clue as to the location of the drivers.  Worst service ever.  WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN" Next time I'm at the store next door around lunchtime  decent menu. I personally like the pizza and wing special." Pizza is awesome! Thanks really needed it while I was studying. Lol  I don't usually like to. The place is run-down and not so cute. But I love supporting local businesses and this is a great one. Beats Domino's or the recently stingy Papa John's any day."  Frank's? Why did you have to break my pizza loving heart?" "The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point  there are more violations on this restaurant than should be legal.  How are they in business??  Please either boycott this restaurant or the health department should shut it down.  Truly awful."  just overpriced and not that great." The food at franks is terrible the worst value for the dollar I wouldnt feed their food to my dog... franks sucks hands down terrible  as i am never ordering from them again. The delivery driver did not understand my frustration with that and was rude and condescending when i complained." I got the 2 slice medium drink combo. The flavor of the pizza was good but very thin. I put the slices on each other and it barely made the thickness of a normal slice. But for 4 dollars its def worth it. "The pizza was ok but the service was terrible. I stopped in for a quick lunch and got the slice special but it ended up taking an hour after waiting several minutes for someone at the front counter and then again for the slices. The place was empty other than myself  but after waiting over 40 minutes for a sandwich we were justified in feeling a bit frustrated. We were the only people there and there were three people working. Overall I saw one or two people stopping for pizza pick-up so maybe that's the way to go?"  but it's still good for the price. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood." This place ROCKS!!! I can't say enough good things! The people are so sweet and wonderful :) This place has great pizza and an amazing price.  It's always fresh and the owner is super friendly. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I have never had a worse experience in my life. Absolutely horrible service. My recommendation is to never go here. Awesome thin crust pizza! I had 2 slices and a pop for $3.99 and they weren't just huge they were so good best pizza I've had so far!  but this is my #1 pizza delivery joint!  We probably get Frank's close to once a week. Delicious pizza and wings every time!" "Awesome! Kind of a divey place and not good for eat in but this is your neighborhood take-out pizza joint! Some reviews complain about bland crust This is the best pizza and wing joint around Phoenix. Place has been renovated and has new owners managers and employees. Ordered pizza and wings it was delicious.  it just kills the entire meal.  I'll never understand how pizza and wing places can have basic ranch that tastes out of a packet."  and service is just as good. Delivery is never cold (and the guy who looks like he's from Son's of Anarchy delivering is a super nice guy)!"  neighborhood pizza spot but worth a try. They have more than just pizza but I've yet try anything..." "Bomb sauce!!! Haha literally!  This is my first time ordering from here.  I will be back for sure.. i ordered the garlic cheese bread..... so good Been going to franks for years. Definitely adding this to my lunch rotation!  The pizza was fresh and hot and delicious!  The service was outstanding and the place was clean.  My only complaint is that I can't get the 2 slices and a soda special delivered. "I was pleasantly surprised how good this pizza was "4 stars bc it's excellent value pizza. Getting pizza by the slice is the best way to order here. Great place for a 6-7 dollar lunch.  It's not a high end fancy place Excellent!!!  We have lots of kids and it was delivered promptly and so very very good! We will definitely be ordering from here again!! We eat lots of pizza by far the best we have had yet :) We had the calazone  and it was so stuffed and yummy. Cheese sticks were way more then we expected and the turkey  sandwich was to die for :) and pizza was devoured! Definitely will recommend to anyone and everyone I know :)  and pizza was rubbery from sitting in the warmer too long. What a waste of time and money. There are MANY better options out there for pizza than Frank's." Family owned and operated."  they were right on the dot! I cannot thank them enough for making my wife's birthday memorable!!!! She said the pizza was fantastic!!" "lets just say i lost sleep thinking about eating my leftover slice from here.. but i maintained and was resilient in making myself wait for morning  the crust was so thick and the whole thing was under cooked (I'm not sure what was cooking for the 40min I waited for this thing!) Even after throwing slices into my own oven to try to crisp them up  but not anymore. We will be sure to dissuade anyone from using Franks for their pizza delivery. Too bad I stopped in for lunch being I just moved in the area. I ordered the two pieces of pie and drink. Rather then it sitting around on a pan in the back room. This came right out of the oven and super hot. Had to wait a bit to cool down. The pieces were large and had great cheese and sauce. I will order again. 4 cheese pizza is amazing  will definitely be coming back again!" "My kids love Frank's Pizza and Wings! I love using the Yelp/ Eat24 app to order so thanks for getting on board with that Franks!!  I absolutely could not feel good about giving the fifth star because of pizza cost and delivery times. I actually drove in to pick up my pizza and was there and back with pizza in like 30 minutes the other day. When we get delivery we are usually waiting an hour at least. That is no fun. Also It also took sixty minutes which is absurd for a pizza I order at 11 AM." Would I return?  Probably not.  Frank's is just too far of a drive for me when better and cheaper pizza is available closer to home.  But  finally got to a person who couldn't then my order.  I was then put on hold to talk with a ""manager"".  I am not sure what he manages ***Best part: Delivery was IMPECCABLY fast!***"  so I order through grub hub.  I would recommend this place "Great pizza! Not those damn tiny teeny 1 person pizzas for $20 like most places in downtown Phoenix! HUGE big slice delicious greasy heaven. And yes "The most delicious pizza I have had in a very long time!  Not only delicious pizza My friends and I had pizza delivered. It tasted decent.  I was impressed with how quick it was delivered and the pizza was still very hot.  my order got here in a timely manner and I must say it was amazing pizza. Will be ordering franks again that's for sure." "I called ahead for a postponed delivery; the pizza arrived 20 minutes later than scheduled. I ordered thin/crispy crust; it was thin I wish there was an option for zero stars! This place has the worse service and even more terrible delivery service! Waited for an hour and a half for delivery called 7 times to cancel the order for them to hang up once and then tell me they can't give me my money back! They were extremely rude and not helpful at all! Went by the other day. Closed sign on the window This is location has indoor tables to eat at if you want someone else to clean up the mess - just order at the counter and they'll bring the pizza to your table when it's ready." This sucked I am going to see if I can get another place to deliver to me.!!" So the Tuscani pasta and the boneless wings called me up and were like what's up bitch you know you want us...so hence I got the pasta and some bone out wings. Lets just say my order was there in about 20 minutes...uber fast. and it was perfect. Nuff said."  Small Price Menu; And OMG The Edge I Remember Back In The Day When They Had It By My Favorite Pizza! Everyone Need To Try The Edge If You Haven't Yet I Promise It Will Become Your Favorite Pizza; Eat-it So It Won't Go Away Again!  And We All Know Pizza Is Good For Every Meal. And I Agree With Perry The Pastas Are Awesome I've Had All Of Them!"  always a few minutes late. Sometimes I indicate pick up and the order gets delivered to my home."  they got my order wrong! Scary neighborhood and parking lot full. I had to park in the shopping complex next to this one."  they hung up on us!! Went in and they said a 50 minute wait AND said that there would be a $1 PER TOPPING charge which is NOT what it said on the online special!! This place is a rip off!!"  unlike your delivery. Ordered at 2:53pm on a Tuesday. Delivered at 3:51. Had to microwave both mozzarella sticks and pizza since they were apparently sitting around. Delivery driver was polite and friendly." Disappointed AGAIN! 3rd time in a row they have been 10 mins late and pizza has been warm. Not like the warm out of the oven but warm like sitting in a car. I used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits.  Amazing that it takes an hour to deliver and I live 5 mins away. "Took forever. Paper plates. No red pepper. Hair in my food. Phone rang off the hook. Dirty lobby and dinning room. Hmmmm  didn't get a hot pizza and it was kind of soggy on bottom both times. I decided to try them again with a Free large 1-topping pizza coupon I received. Called to order the pizza  and my pizza was cold . I don't think I'll order from this location again ." Just a fail all around.  The 2 stars is for the delivery guy.  He was nice Why the hell do they let dogs inside of this place...that's disgusting..what goes on in the back?!!.. .I'll be getting a refund soon "This is the closest Pizza Hut to where I live. We've ordered here a few times. One time everything was perfect. The second time  then they just hung up. Happened twice.  Their service couldn't be worse." They had someone new take my delivery order. She screwed it up but after an hour the manager Manny corrected it all for free plus sent me a warm and gooey Hershey's pie!!! All no charge. Ty! It was absolutely horrible. We ordered delivery and after two hours it hadn't arrived. We called at the hour mark to see what was going on and was told it was in the next car to go out. I then called again after 40 minutes and found out our pizza wasn't even made yet! I'm sorry but that's unacceptable. We canceled our order and are never ordering from this Pizza Hut again. I finally get my delivery 1hour and 20 minutes later! Of course it's cold.... and all I wanted was some pizza. This place clearly lacks in delivery and customer service. I'd give negative 10 stars Rude employees and told me I wasn't allowed to order from them again. Like I would Took me a week to get a hold of the manager who would give me a credit for the shit service and the shit food. Used the credit for pick up  I've only got food from here twice and OF COURSE both times they screwed it up.  I had been craving their bread sticks so I got them with my pizza and they forget the sauce.  Like  then they tried calling me 30 min before when the pizza was supposed to be delivered but my phone never rang. If you're going to BS me at least keep your story straight... don't bother with this place. I know I'm done."  the place appeared dingy. One employee was scratching his head and did not wash his hands before touching the food. When I received my food all seemed okay. However when i went to eat a wing Service sucks especially on the phone a girl that every time she sounds stoned gettin the orders wrong. Not paying attention when u r paying with card. Love pizza hut hate this location. Please somebody do something about it!!!!!! One of the worst locations!!! I just called to place a order and was told that they didn't have any beef toppings. Called 2 weeks ago and it wasn't any dough.  WTF!!! *Update:  We are outside of their delivery area.  : (" http://www.patspizzaplus.com/"  but I was happy to not get the usual pickled rings. No one I've brought here has said anything other than wow. Bring cash if only getting one special; they have $5 debit/charge minimum." I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome.  find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza.  My only regret was that I had to share it.  Next time - its all mine."  but there is one thing that I really hate and it just drives me crazy!  The food is too good that I don't know what to choose!  The pizza is just as good as any pizza place in NYC.  The appetizers and wings are fantastic.  If you have a appetite of a horse  but how can you say anything bad about a place like that?" I think the crust was a fluke so I will definitely give it another shot." Have a little faith in your customers _GVAV2LjUWEs9fGjslex_A I think there are plenty of other quality pizza joints out here now that are as good  all I tried was one pizza but it really stood out as a place to avoid in a neighborhood with plenty of fantastic pizza and other Italian food." "They found ""it"". There are only a handful of places in this town that know how to make pizza. Anyone who would find a problem with this pie needs to get back to their Digiorno's......."  they tend to be on the soggy side. Their salads are huge and delicious and there is something magical in the ranch they use.. I get take out here at least twice a month and they have never done me wrong. They have great lunch specials too." "The pizza is really good. Just make sure you're on your A game - like other people have said  but I have also witnessed the type of clientele that go in there and have been tempted a few times to bitch slap someone for their oblivious rudeness to the employees of Pat's." GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw Good luck with this place.." "Quality control seems to have disappeared here.  The crust is a disaster these days... and they're really slow... 45 minutes is too long to wait for a casual  I'll be back again on my next visit in Pheonix....." Some of the best pizza I've tasted! The sicilian is yum and it weighs a ton.  and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky." I will update my review as I try other pies."  I tried the thin crust pizza.  It was better than the Sicilian  I have to drive 22 miles once a month just to get my fix.  It doesn't matter... I'd drive 500 miles for a slice of Pat's."  the crust is rock-hard and has a bit of a cardboard taste and their sauce and cheese lack flavor. The portion size is decent There is nothing fancy about this place or the pizza. The sauce was nothing special and the crust was rather thin and hard. I go because there is a lunch special of 2 slices of plain cheese pizza and a soda for $3. Its fine for a quick meal but nothing spectacular. The people are nice and I am always glad to support local businesses. Just don't expect me to cheer on the Yankees." I absolutely love this place for a quick no frills cheap lunch.  Two slices and a soda for just over $3 and that pizza is actually good!  the only issue this place has is with parking.  Ever since Paradise Bakery opened in the same complex you usually can't find a parking spot after 11:30.    If you have a chance you should give this locally owned non-franchise spot a try. The lunch special (11am-2pm) here is really cheap.  You get two cheese pizza slices and a drink for $3.00 + tax.  It's additional if you want to add toppings." This little hole in wall joint never disappoints.  The food is good and the friendly service better.   The prices are reasonable. The pizza and wings special is great. 22 bucks and  some change for a large with 2 toppings and 30 wings! Great Pizza & Wing special. Always  Pizza Hut when there are delicious hidden gems like this in the valley! Don't waste your time on those changes and support your local businesses! The food is way better anyway!! :-)"  or revel in the fact that it is a dive.  But keep this neighborhood place in the rotation.  There aren't enough mom and pop places out there that we can support.  It's sandwiched between a zoyo and a paradise bakery for cripe's sake." "Good little local pizza place.  We got the Twin Tower special which was a 16"" 2 topping pizza and 30 wings for 23 bucks.  What was amazing was this pizza was a huge square and a full 16"" .. We opted for the thick crust which I really wasn't crazy about but I'm sure many people would love..it was more of a crunchy toasted kinda crust.  Wings were really good and service was very friendly and attentive. I would go back to try the thin crust and some of their specialty pizzas." lG6Q5OvamVHUSk9MPE6Q4A Update: We've now been able to order flats only." Must remember this place next time I get pizza and support local business instead of Papa John's!"  and garlic! And they don't skimp on the garlic! Breath is horrible but I love it!! So good!!!!! Keeps me coming back!" "Want to grab a few slices for lunch; also wanted to try based on a recommendation from a co-worker...I'm glad I did; the slices were great - I cannot wait to try a whole pizza or some of the wings Over all... I doubt I would be back." "We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it Pat's has the best wings in the valley! Some of my favorite NYC style crust. Everything here is great! Sorry... my fingers are too saucy to type!!!  and crazy tasty. Stop in for a slice of pizza the size of your head for a super reasonable price!" Stetson ""The Brand Man"" Brandish" crust was bland. $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all. Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius. Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's. Never again!" qxnFi49a-i0O_t_RROWYdg  I mostly go there for the pizza. The lunch special is such a deal!! 2 giant slices with 1 or 2 toppings I think and a drink for less than $5. Service is always great Good pizza and wings and very nice people. You can't beat the lunch special for $5.00. I would recommend. R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP. Was heading next store to paradise for a sandwich when I thought I'd try this place instead. I ordered the Italian hoagie toasted with everything. So good! The hoagie took me right back to growing up on the east coast!  Well done Pats your hoagie was perfection. : ) "I ordered 5 large pizzas for a party I had last weekend and they were great.  I popped in early in the day and placed my order.  The pizzas were hot and ready on time.  We got a variety of pizzas and they were really good.  The spicy chicken pesto was the biggest hit.  Totally perfect for the party.  All my friends were asking about the place I ordered from.  They have awesome wings too.  Plus  which tastes slightly different. I was hoping for crumbled sausage but it was still really good! The dinner salad came with two rolls and two dressing containers. I give it 4 starts because the salad was a little lacking. It was lettuce  not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request "I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and You won't be disappointed." This is a small and simple place that happens to make incredible pizza!  The crust is thin and crispy with a flavor that reminds me of Pizza in New York. They offer many specials. I ordered for pick up and it was ready when I got there. They were very nice and I will be having their pizza many times in the future!  it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again "The best pizza in the area..the delivery driver Andy is awesome I came here recently while staying  Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak at the for an alternative to the terrible frozen pizza they serve.  Call it in  we were very disappointed. It was not as good as he or I remembered. In the early 80's and 90's this place was good. The pizza was awesome and the inside of the restaurant had some charm. That is definitely not the case now. The pizza was extremely bland and not very flavorful at all. We decided to try the wings but backed out after trying the sauce. It was very vinegary. Seems like the quality of the food has changed and the inside is just like the pizza.......boring. After so many generations of eating at Pats  not soggy. Great tasting toppings and nice cosy environment to eat in. I haven't tried every pizza out there. But I enjoy the taste every time I get one. That's what counts. So far the best in town that I've found." The best NY styled pizza anywhere near here I come hear often to get their pizza it's great. I would recommend coming in for lunch they have a great pizza combo for lunch!  but they do have a few tables. I drove the pizza from their address to my house near south mountain and it was still hot and crunchy. Give them a try." Staying at The Pointe Hilton had a craving for pizza. This place was worth the call and they delivered right to our room. Better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns if you want something different. We had the large pizza and wings special for about $25 and added the New York White with a total of $48. The wing hot sauce is so good and the pepperoni had a good flavor also. I gave it 5 stars because it seems like this place is underrated. I'm from NY and this is the closest thing to NY... sooo good to.   my first time but sure to return.   had the pizza and meatball / Italian sausage grinder. Delicious Sicilian pizza! With the exact texture crust a sicilian slice should have.  I moved here from NY and this is my go-to place for my monthly (sometimes more:/ ) pizza fix.  but I heard wrong. I made my own large pepperoni and sausage pizza. The dough was pretty horrific. It was hard and had a very bland taste to it. I felt like I was eating a worse version of Sardella's...The toppings were a whole different story. The sausages and pepperonis were a joke. They were extremely tiny and looked like they were bought from the dollar store. For 18 bucks  much higher quality.  I am profoundly disappointed and will not be returning.  I suspect from the reviews I have seen on here that dining in the restaurant results in a profoundly different experience... so I wouldn't discourage that.  If Unexpectedly wonderful! We stopped in for a quick bite and I'm so glad we did! It's a quaint little family pizzeria.   the pizza contained a lot of bread and very little of everything else.  The pizza looks like toasted texas toast bread with some toppings on it.  I would recommend viewers to try for themselves though.  We really love Rosatis Pizza but is too far a distance and maybe we had too high of expectations when going to Pats." I had food delivered. It arrived before the time it said it would. That was the only good thing about it. The mozzarella sticks were cold. I had to reheat them. The salad that comes with the pasta had more onions on it the lettuce. The fettucini Alfredo pasta tasted like sour cream. The garlic bread was not good. Never gonna order from there again. The parking lot was less crazy on the Paradise Bakery side in the evening  I order it for my little family and it's as delicious as when I was 6. Another thing I get is the lunch special  I tried Pat's for the first time this evening and I was pleasantly surprised!! The service was friendly and the pizza was fantastic!! The best pizza I have had here in Phoenix!! I would highly recommend going to Pat's!! I will definitely being going back!! :)  but this is just the right amount of thin - it's the type of pizza slice where you just fold that bitch in half and stuff it in your mouth. I will definitely be going back here when my next lunchtime pizza craving hits." Don't know how this place has 3 1/2 stars it's always been 5 stars for my husband and I. Excellent pizza and amazing wings and the staff is always awesome. Small place with 7 tables with red and white checkered table cloths.  It's a favorite for date night. We drive from Surprise to eat here.  def a hot deal. This is also the fianc and I's go-to pizza delivery spot. Best ny style pizza in Phoenix in my opinion. Always friendly and the delivery is typically quicker than the time they quote you. When doing delivery ordering the pizza well done helps the crust to hold its integrity since sometimes it can be a tiny bit soggy by the time it gets to you. Wings extra crispy bc crispy wings are the best! Keep up the good work Pat's!"  but you have to treat yourself once in a while. Perfect thing to impress your beer drinking buddies."  just what I like. The 2 slice special is a deal  delicious and NY style! Staff is also great Giving these guys a five because the were so friendly and the pizza was great.  We had the margherriti pizza.  It had a a good flavor.  The extra crispy wings were good too.  If you want a small local place come here and help them out.  The prices were good also.  hole-in-the-wall place is the closest Phoenix comes to NY style pizza. We had the slice special and were very happy. We're going to try them for take-out next." Stumpys is closed on Sunday which I respect. So we thought we would try Pat's. The pizza really had no flavor. I will not go back. I have eaten here twice and it's amazing. I have ordered pepperoni pizza with mushrooms both times and the mushrooms were very good. The wings are delicious and crispy too. I ordered on Super Bowl Sunday on a whim about an hour before the game and it came within 45 minutes. Will be eating here again.  once when I went to pick up food i could hear people fighting about prices and whatnot in the back and they just all seemed stressed out (They were very busy due to football games). Not something a customer should ever see Best pizza in town. If you are from New York then this is the pizza joint you have been looking for! "We had their lunch special pizza and their wings. Pizza reminded me of the NYC style think crust and large very delicious! Wings were cooked good with hot and medium buffalo sauce We will try them out again..and maybe check out some other items off the menu." "Best pie in the valley. From the crust to the sauce to the cheese. Hands down I prefer to eat in for the super hot pizza."  family-owned joint inside a strip of mostly manicure shops. Don't be put off  there is just something about the sauce!"  love it! You can bring your own booze too! A little bit of a wait but not bad." You know its going to be bad when you pick it up & the box feels like its going to dissolve in your hands."  they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*" I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out. The service was awful and was given by high schoolers who obviously had more important things to be doing. I think they must of screwed up the batch of sauce because it was so sweet I couldn't even have bite number 2. I don't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce. The party I was with was a bit less picky but needless to say we didn't box the left overs which were plentiful. Spinato's offers pasta dishes which I'd like to try as well a garlic bread and antipasti. I look forward to visiting Spinato's again!"  they love it and they go back for more and introduce their friends to it. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Nello's gets lots of props in Phoenix but I promise you YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ Fast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice  and shrooms with a few cheap bottles from Safeway across the street = a night of fun for all your friends.  I have NO idea what people are hattin' on the 'nato's for "I have never actually sat down inside but Ive ordered out from here 2x. I think they're the best pizza in town..not for the crust..( I myself am a fan of doughy crust not deep dish but not thin either)...but for the sauce. It's fantastic. It has a hint of sweet to it which just makes it unique and delicious  moved away by three and have never been back.  So as an adult I have missed out on all the great cusine known from this midwest mecca of a city.  This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago.  I love the pizza here as well as the down to earth relaxing atmosphere.  Servers have always been great to me.  I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place.  Until I take a vacation to the windy city All three just rock my world rz9clJi_pIj_JxI_wG0wNg  and the wait time was 25 minutes on a Saturday night.  There was a good-sized wine and beer menu  in my neighborhood. The pizza was awesome!!!!!! I will be going back Tomorrow for round 2." I can't get enough of this pizza. Tonight I took my friend there for her birthday..started with the house salad which was crisp and refreshing.. the ranch was ranch and didn't taste like seasoned mayo.awesome. I ordered the lil margherita and couldnt wait to taste that sweet goodness they have for a sauce and lo and behold the margherita is a white pizza???? You know what? It didnt matter it was magnificent without the signature sauce. This place is the best pizza place in Phoenix...hands down  I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me The pizza was Chicago style and phenomenal! (See pictures) The pizza ingredients were really fresh and the sauce (OH THE SAUCE) tangy and sweet. The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza. Spinato's beats any delivery in my area (Sorry Pat's) and has made the rotation in to my favorite Chicago style pizza. I can't wait to actually try the restaurant  and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap Their sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive."  but I just can't get into the sweetness of the pizza sauce.  I will try it again secret hint: they put sugar in the sauce.. no wonder it's so darn good!!!" LwbCh2rhnfaFOhzw7gE1TA  and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here "I recently revisited Spinato's with my parents and brother's family. Though I thought their pizza was really good I was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was. I could have just eaten that with a little salad and have been very happy. The portions were generous. I saw one of the calzones and WOW...it was huge! I really want to go back for one (seriously You know when you play those party conversation-type games? What one thing would you take to a deserted island? What book changed your life? If you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life what would it be? My answer is Spinato's pizza. YUMMY!" "GREAT pizza place!  The thin crust pizza is AMAZING!  I ordered take out for the first time and everything was absolutely perfect.  The dining room seemed to be fairly busy "Simply THE BEST PIZZA in the Valley of the Sun.  The sauce is perfection and every kind of pizza I've had has been superb.  Reasonable prices I'd suggest for take-out or for a very casual meal out. Not a date night kind of place."  Spinato's!  Somehow your unbelievably delicious Mama's Original pizza made a spinach-lover out of my 4-year-old.  Amazing!  We also love the Spicy Italian (who doesn't like spicy Italians?!).  The antipasto salad with half spinach is always crisp "Some primo eats... period. Me likes the beer specials I've happened upon there. If you want to know what a moron is Give these people your money I highly recommend pepperoni with extra cheese. Yum!" All I can say is: Go as soon as possible to get some great pizza! "Yu-u-u-M!  The sauce is a sweet and not too acidic and the spaghetti and meatball calzone (add ricotta) is cravable! I saw the meatball sandwich and can't believe a single human being could consume one on their own. I swear it must be three pounds of meatballs on a full french loaf! I only wish they were open for lunch on Sundays because for some reason that's when I always think "I'm giving them a 5 just for their spaghetti and meatball calzone. It sounds awful "I was so excited to try it because people rave. NOT a fan. I guess if you like super sweet sauce it will be up your alley. I couldn't eat it. I will stick to Joe's pizza or Slice of Sicily "My family and I have been coming to Spinato's for 13 years and obviously we love it. We order one of their pizzas at least once a week  the salad is always fresh too - best to eat there -"  I make sure to stop by here. The spinach pizza is my favorite. I also like to get the family style half and half salad. i've been going there for years and it's always delicious!" IwiupaUMeltnd0a9Cp15tA Then we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch). All I can say is: EAT HERE "The food is Yummy! The people are pleasant.  Little expensive  but I bet it's manly indeed. Extra star for square cutting the pie. Spinato's is what pizza is ALL about."  but it's well worth the trip down the 51 to pick it up.  The staff is alway nice and will remember you after a few trips.  All around - great food "I had a great experience at Spinato's Saturday night. The food and service was awesome. We started out with garlic and cheese breadsticks with marinara. Orgasimic. :) There were three of us dining  which was nostalgic and fun. Then we shared the mixed salad which was nice. I swear if I had a bigger purse I would've swiped the cute balsamic/olive oil holder. I mean My favorite pizza place in Phoenix! YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ Family owned and super fresh ingredients. Their pizza sauce is the best I've ever had. Their salads are great too. Even the delivery guys are the best. Love this place!  when in the area we stop here. Just wish it was closer to me.  The sauce is unique and wonderful." Most of all - I'm absolutely THRILLED that they have a location in the Tuke.  Unfortunately - like all their locations they don't take reservations so either get their early By far my favorite Pizza ever.  Just had it again last night and it was great.  Called ahead and picked it up.  You guys rock pizza.  Can't wait to try the new location...that has a different menu.  I've taken many people to try your pizza and they all agree that it's the Best.  although that wait was longer than expected and the waiting area was HOT! It was all well worth the wait. :)" I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again. Can't get enough of Spinato's pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The combination of the sweet sauce and cheese blend makes for the perfect pizza. If you haven't tried Spinato's I will definitely be back!!!" And it alone warrants 5 stars."  meatballs.... a lot of food. Their pizza is always good and my brother swears that this location is the best and has the best crust of all the locations. I thought the pizza was good We ordered online and picked it up...I am always a fan of not having to call and place an order.  I have an aversion to talking on the phone.  I have no idea why." Our family always enjoys a night a spinatos. We always request Lorenzo as our server.  you just have to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs Calzone.  Ask for it with Ricotta  and the next day as well. I am not sure what they put in that pizza but I am addicted. It would be dangerous if I lived close.... I will definitely be back."  but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING.  I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good.  Check this place out for eat in or for take-out.  Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks." You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Perfect for dining in or take out!"  it is a pizza hut reminiscent thick crust. which in my mind. Not a good thing. The thin crust is the way to go if you come to spinatos"  cooked to be a little crunchy with lightly browned cheese. Zesty "First visit...Very busy; but worth the wait to get a table...First of all; like the selection of ""discontinued"" wine and beer; didn't try - but great concept.  Had the pizza; my roommate had the calzone.  Both items were hot out of the oven; tasted excellent.  Service was great.  Will definately be back again!!!" There was gelato there. I ordered two scoops vanilla and then one scoop dark chocolate. The dark chocolate was good. The vanilla was a bit sweet for me." My favorite pizza joint in the PHX metro area!  the ""mamma's spinach"" pizza was really good! Garlic  if you're into that kind of thing. Kiddo's plain cheese pizza was even good. Then we ordered a to-go super veggie pizza for round two. That was delicious as well. Good service My partner and I were polite and ate the pizza in front of him but once he left we threw away the leftovers.(which was quite a lot) Not only that but they show off some 2008 ""Best food winner"" from the Scottsdale culinary festival. All I know for sure is those judges probably had absolutely no taste buds. They aren't open today(monday) but believe me  a must order with pizza and anything really. Haha. Dining in or Togo its awesome. One of my face pizza places next to al forno on Glendale and 57th ave."  an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two). Well done Spinato's "This place has really good thick and thin crust pizza.  I've never been a fan of thin crust because of it being so crispy and it just wasn't good to me.  However "From the husband (native Chicagoan):  ""I've not had pizza this good west of St. Louis."" That said  attentive and outgoing (Brittany).  My wife was seven months pregnant at the time and when the bill came they had placed a baby Spinato's shirt on the table and told us congratulations.  I thought that it was very kind gesture. Go for the pizza but enjoy the family atmosphere too." I have been to 3 locations and they are all fantastic! Mama's signature pizza with spinach is out of this world! Such a great place. The one on glendale was byob at one time which was nice as well.  delicious food in a family environment! Whats there not to love? We left with a smile on our face and lots of pizza :)"  I like their ""Get Meaty"" pie and the ""spicy italian"". Salads are good. They have a wine special on Wednesday's that's pretty sweet (50% off on bottles  could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me." Be sure to go there on Tuesday for the Beer specials. They have Peroni & Stella on tap. Yum!" Never have had a bad experience here and I have been here at least 10 times. Staff is always welcoming and polite. Also if you happen to have room at the end of your meal order the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies."  which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1 "Best Pizza ever!! ingredients are fresh. you get quality pizza! For a good price!""" Are you kidding me with this place... :) I love it. The food is amazing and the service is friendly. Its clean and fast. LOVE the calzones. good for carry out or dine in when the place isn't packed" "The pie is pricey and sweet but you'll be back! Great mom-n-pop shop feel  but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights  and onion - Lil' size - pan/thick crust.  What I ordered was just the right size for a lunch or dinner serving especially if you don't want to have to worry about any leftovers.  The crust was crunchy yet soft and tasty.  The prices are pretty average but the service is attentive.  It can get a little noisy in this place very easily so keep that in mind if you are looking for a more quiet atmosphere."  our service experience was not so great.  My boyfriend got one of the specialty pizzas and asked for it to come with onions instead of mushrooms.  Little did we know that this was considered ""building your own pizza"" and as a result we were charged more.  When the bill came and we asked about it  Pat's Pizza.  Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy.  The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side.  In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak.  But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?"  she was hungry.  The service didn't take away from the fact that the pizza was SOOOO cheesey and delicisous.  I love the cross cutting style.  I can't decribe it any other way than utter cheesy goodness.  If you love your pizza cheesy and gooey and messy..this is the place for you.  If you are in the mood for whole wheat I am craving pizza right now and know that I will be placing an order at Spinatos to take home for dinner tonight. I have been a customer for about three years now and it is my favorite pizza ever!!! It will change your life...  the extra sauce was spread around the top of the pizza...COLD which made the pizza disgusting already the sausage was nothing to write home about. good service i suppose and that's the only reason i'm not giving it 1 star We have only gotten take-out so far but look forward to eating in next time we go out." Visiting or live in Phoenix??? NEED TO GO HERE for Pizza!!  MMMMmmmm  and I have not found a pizza place that even comes close to Chicago for me here in Phoenix - until now.  Spinato's is a pretty darn close Chicago-style pizza.  I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere  the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise)." Soo good! One of our fav spot. This and oreganos! :) The lemonade is my favorite and the meat lovers pizza!  I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult." Awesome!!!!!  Great service!!!   Do not miss this neighborhood gem!!! YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ Their wait staff is always good and very efficient. It's always crowded so try not to go at peak times."  but don' t let that fool  you. This place is the REAL DEAL when it comes to great pizza in the Valley. Their specialty is this marinated spinach and tomato pizza and it's awesome. WE opted to each order our own personal pizza I hope you are within range of them for delivery because you will never order from a major chain again." In my humble opinion...best pizza in the valley. One of my all time favorite restaurants but today's delivery girl was a little ray of sunshine! Such a refreshing change from most delivery people! Thank you spinatos for being a cut Above! Went here in the middle of the week and there was a line outside the place to pick up to go orders and the dining room had about a 30 minute wait so they are really busy and I can see why. I got a Nicole's new favorite pizza here and it was one of the best pizza I have had in Phoenix. I love this place and plan to become a regular. This pizza is delicious. What more is there to say?? Overall - good food and decent service so I would probably recommend. Still  but I'm still on my pursuit for the best or a great pizzeria in the Phoenix area." I've been meaning to write this for a long time.  Check it out for yourself.  I doubt you'll be disappointed!" "My family and I have been here several times and have NEVER had bad food  2 kids - when the check came I truly felt it was a great deal. We've been twice and it's instantly become a favorite. Signature Spinach extra crispy - love the garlic - so good."  but the mushrooms were canned. Gross. The sauce was also way too sweet. Definitely not my favorite pizza and I won't be ordering from there again  and I wanted to taste pizza that reminded her of home. She loved it. We all loved. My mother and I split a medium pizza. My half was Mama Spinato's signature fresh spinach and hers was the Chicago. My husband had a medium Nicole's new favorite. All of the pizza was amazing. Before dinner In ordered a dinner salad. I figured it would keep me from devouring my whole pizza. The salad was also really good. Throughout our meal  but because their pizza and service are both amazing.  This thin crust Chicago style pizza is almost identical to the Aurelios pizza I grew up on in the south suburbs of Chicago.  It's pizza perfection.  The brownie dessert is to die for.  We didn't try to calzone but saw lots of other customers who ordered them."  so I can only speak about the food really.  I have ordered carry out and delivery many times from this place and have never had a bad experience.  Everything is always really fresh.  When I have done carryout the employees were always nice and attentive.  The delivery staff is always good as well.  Delivery has taken up to an hour at times on lunch A good find and we would definitely go back."  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone: so many carbs "I joined Yelp because of this place!  We saw lots of positive reviews while we did a staycation at nearby Pointe Hilton.  We weren't disappointed.  I don't think pizza will ever be the same in my eyes again.  I had the L'Italiana and it was incredible.  Great sauce Spinato's is wonderful!!! Their signature spinach pizza is to die for!! Every time we have a chance to order pizza for our work we always chose Spinato's. They are super friendly and we have never been disappointed. Definitely worth trying out if your in the mood for pizza! Try the mama's special (I think that is the name) with the marinated spinach. I know it doesn't sound great but it is amazing (throws another pair of sweatpants into the cart at Costco)." vDgwmj--1XON0TKCTov9-Q  and toasty cheese tossed with love! I always add onions for that extra kick.. Pizzas can be shared and split into 2 different combinations (they even separate it with a line of tomato sauce so you know which is which) dessert is the only department they lack in.. Cannoli's are no bueno :( the dough tastes old and the cream filling is too sweet.  Overall  I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ "Eating here for years and always enjoy the food. Customer service is a major reason I come back to most places. Tonite I called for delivery because I've been sick for a week. The manager took my order and was incredibly nice with get well wishes. Upon delivery "This place has the best gluten-free pizza in town. Even if you aren't gluten free if you like thin crust "I love Spinato's pizza.  I usually get a gluten free Get Meaty.  The gluten free crust is better than any I've had.  Their regular crust is YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ qhoZ5wQzUkvCptlbMmXpjw  I learned that they are moving locations in the next couple weeks I'm happy I finally tried their pizzas and will definitely return to try other combos and hopefully also check out their brand new dining space." The family-owned local chain that's been making old-school Chicago-style pies in the Valley just shy of 40 years has announced their newest location "I just visited their new location at 7th Street and Missouri.  The baked spaghetti calzone (with meatballs and ricotta cheese) put me into a wonderful afternoon food coma.  The personal size is more than enough for a filling lunch "I really like the pizza. We ordered the 7"" personal size custom toppings ! The red sauce was the best I have ever had. On the sweeter side but amazing . Crust was perfect fairly thin and crispy . I loved it."  so we where very exited when we found out their new location was only 4 blocks away from our home ""WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT'' the menu is lacking some of their best dishes we ordered a pizza I don't know if they got new cooks or he was having a bad day I ordered the spaghetti with the side of meatballs and you only get 2 choices of sauce COME ON ""spaghetti factory you can order the spaghetti with meatballs"" I guess if you have to buy separate they charge you more money witch is ridiculous for frozen meatballs I took a bite and it was cold and wet inside  I asked for the manager and he never came  which works well with their sauce!"  and after I said something to an EXTREMELY loud waitress at the table behind us (geez servers This location has moved to the corner of Missouri & 7th St; talk about making a good thing better." Very romantic.  The restaurant is at the very top of a butte with a stellar view of the city.  The city lights look like a blanket of stars from this vantage point at night.  White glove service.  Continental cuisine.  The food is good  so much better.  And the selection is very limited.  But if you are trying to impress a date  the price was not justified.  If you are going to charge starting price of $40 an entree  if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...." But hey...if the view and ambiance are what you're after "We were staying at the resort for a July 4th ""staycation.""  We decided to splurge and have dinner here the night of the 4th. What a great decision!  The food was excellent  we look forward to it each time we trek to Arizona. If you are looking for an upscale and unique dinner experience/ dinner with a great view  but not nearly as good as enjoying a cigar and some drinks on the patio prior to and after dinner inside. This would be a perfect place to take a date and have a nice glass of wine while taking in the view of the ever sprawling Phoenix area." I would love to try this place again since the food and view were great.  I would just hope that my service next time would be better."  and the presentation was phenomenal. Definitely have to make a reservation here.  Our bill came out to be about 230  what a beautiful place.  The drive up was incredible and the view was just amazing.  The service/food/drinks were great the entire night and what a wonderful night sitting out by the fireplace looking out over the city.  Great place for a Party and I can't wait to go back for a nice little romantic dinner for two.  Maybe I'll be back with 5 stars?"  the food is almost always wonderful... the inconsistancy is the service.  It is a great place to bring friends from out of town  you will find a lot of the time that the vegetarian dishes are usually a LOT better...in this case ps the bar a level lower is also great. Dance floor and outside patio with view. GREAT!!!"  especially when you assume that you may be just ""paying for the view"".  Not true at all.  The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town.  I had the Port Cabernet Braised Kobe Short Rib: Fresh Sweet Corn Polenta  or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice though nothing outstanding and the chocolate amandine had a flat pre-packaged taste- after a few bites we left the remainder. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food."  save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot." We will definitely come back and are happy that we found a 5 star restaurant in our neighborhood."  was.. it's been a while since i was here last). the chicken dishes are kind of boring and my mom's had stomach upsets a few times I've eaten ion fine dining establishments all over the globe for over 30 years and this one is in my personal top 5. Not cheap or even reasonable by anyone's standards but this one backs up the tab in spades! A tad on the high end but what a view!!!! Food was wonderful and the staff was friendly. Well worth the extra money  and you better bet you'll see me outside any time someone comes to visit!"  didn't care for the sauce and wished he had ordered the halibut too.  The dessert menu was very odd  but not until I've exhausted the list of other 4 diamond (AAA  rating) restaurants in the city."  but more of a place to go and get drinks with good friends.  The food has ranged from excellent to good.  I had possibly the best lemon drop martini of my life here.  The seafood dishes are excellent.  I also ordered a brussel sprout salad which was amazing.  The steak was ok.  I've had better.  Would definitely recommend this place for a quiet dinner with good friends.  Try to get a table that faces outward.  Its really all about the view."  pork belly tasty.  Service a little distracted.  Romantic?...could be but large groups increase the noise level consiserably.  View? Fantastic. Would highly recommend."  creme brle for me and some sort of chocolate flourless thing for my husband. Both were good Another great find from Yelp." Restaurant itself was very nice. View was very good next to the windows. The ribeye was only average but the chicken was very good. Creme brulee and the chocolate espresso desserts were excellent. My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.  good food! Host started the evening off rocky but rest of staff was excellent. We've eaten here a couple times and although the food is always good  or a friend/relative you want to treat to a 5 star dinner you can't go wrong here! The food is very unique and delicious. This restaurant has one of the best wine cellars in town and the right people to lead you in the right direction for a good pairing. Oh and I can't forget to mention the ridiculously amazing view from the cliff top overlooking the Phoenix valley! This place is truly a Phoenix gem." Happy Valentine's Day!!! Make it special..."  service and view. Not to be missed." "THE BEST lobster bisque...everything else is just ok.  Oh yeah  and I liked the tiered outdoor seating areas.  The bartenders had a great sense of humor and everyone had a nice time.  The other staff were friendly as well."  and the creme brule for dessert.  I sampled their lobster bisque and I wish I had gotten that instead of the duck ravioli.  My filet minon was cooked well done because I am currently pregnant and it was still surprisingly tender.  The creme brule was delightful as well." Great food. The service could have been slightly better. I don't see why my drink should ever run dry when it's just a Coke. Best view of PHX in town. I would never go to Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris if I could get a reservation here. nfdr8ugyW7hWxpbQjw65Ag  so not worth complaining if you don't get a window seat." I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"  say that the view was amazing and it's not as though the people were't kind because they were. But for the $ 'Dissapointing Pointe of View'"  we'll go for the flourless chocolate instead.  Wonderful evening... this is a great place for a special night out or to impress visiting family and friends... We're planning to return more often to the Terrace Room for a lower-key evening with a view..."  better than we expected as many of these types of places rely more on their setting than quality. The staff was exceptional Took someone here for their birthday and requested a patio seat 3 weeks in advance but was not accommodated whateves...great views though of phx...as for the food when we arrived we were given a shooter which was very good..for dinner we had the fillet and the chicken with a side of shrimp.everything was super tasty!!!!!i have been to my fair share of fine dining restaurants and usually the service is top notch waiter was below average but would defiantly go back here..  it is really great food and worth every penny!! The view is phenomenal; the city looks serene and calm from high above!" I give very few 5 star reviews however I must say that this place is without doubt the most deserving.  The food is simply amazing as is their outstanding wine list and best views in the valley.  This place will satisfy the most demanding critic.  After a delightful dinner the wife and I spent several hours dancing in the lounge to live music classy music.  This place makes you feel like everyday is a honeymoon.  If you are looking for a place to impress anyone this is it.  Great Job Hilton.  and you can even eat outside when the weather is warm enough.  Just make sure you call in a reservation well in advance to make sure you get a good window table." Yes at A Different Pointe of View Restaurant all of the above can certainly be enjoyed however it's true value is the VIEW of the Valley of the Sun.....it is unmatched. The manager said if we could find a better view in Arizona....please let him know....well I don't know about the Entire state of Arizona....but as for the Valley maybe the view from the Wrigley mansion would come close.....but it can't touch the AWESOME VIEWS you can witness at A Different Pointe of View. Don't take my word for it....just try it for yourself and I think you will see things from a Different Pointe of View as well. Eat Amazing view and atmosphere and the lobster bisque was out of this world.  So rich and creamy. The salad with the strawberries was very fresh and flavorful.  I would highly recommend!  one of the best fine dining options in The Valley. Just review the menu carefully and listen to your server....you don't want to be out-ordered!" it was our first time here and we were thoroughly impressed!"  we suddenly felt massively full. We had a hard time eating the rest of our meal and had to bring most of it home. We both had that sick-full feeling throughout the rest of the night. Maybe it was just us I'd like to bring a date here sometime."  or to bring your out of town guests for drinks and for the view." The service was outstanding and of course the view is worth every penny.  Want to impress or wow a date  but the lounge food was good.  They also serve marshmallows that you can roast in one of the fire pits around.  The view is beautiful  but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different "The most amazing experience ! Chef Anthony's passion comes through with every bite... Ian's service was impeccable. He was a step ahead  we walked out onto the patio and down to the bar section to take some pictures with the city in the background.  The weather was amazing and we were so lucky to have the cityscape as our backdrop.  Dinner was a little pricey but I was glad we could share a fancy dinner on a special occasion."  service off charts and food was as exotic as i have seen i would come back over and over again if i could afford it definatey a special occasion place!!" 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ  and the outside dinning sealed off for another corp event. They didn't let us know ( we had reservations) until we arrived. This was extremely disappointing. All they offered were a bunch of "" I'm sorries"". Very disappointing." "The views from this restaurant are amazing.  We were very pleased with everything from the wine list to the dark chocolate for desert.  The menu is nice the food presentation and qualtiy ""the best""."  I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also  I would also dine out on their patio by the fire pit." We are going to give it one more try and I sincerely hope this was a one-time problem."  about what you'd expect for the price (but that's not why you're here). You're here because those twinkling lights of Phoenix spread out before you both  will whisper sweet nothings to her like nothing YOU could ever think of. Nothing more romantic. So yo  and then never returned to our table until the meal was over.  We had a steak which was significantly undercooked (purple as opposed to medium rare)  the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends." "We were in the lounge on Friday. What a beautiful room and patio. Service was not impressive at all. Our server paid very little attention to us and lacked any kind of professionalism or personality. While we were all chatting and visiting with an out of town guest she came over Everything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"  and slices of duck all around with a raspberry citrus sauce that was absolutely incredible - i ordered it on recommendation of our favorite server - Ian- i was a bit nervous because i don't like duck...BUT Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out."  and great food.  I like to ""wow"" my family from out of town on what a great place the Phoenix/Scottsdale areas are.  This is one of the true bright spots.  I will be coming back again and hopefully for the bar/lounge scene." dptMPpMR2gC2vxxrH57b4w "Nice patio up in the mountains with a view of the Scottsdale area.  Several fire pits for you to sit around and relax.  Choice of Dinner inside/out.  I was there on a company function and there was a set dinner menu.  The food was respectable I was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings.  The view was nice and the drive up was exciting.  But the dinner was anticlimatic that climaxed at the bisque." Five stars for impeccable service by Tim Robbins I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)" "My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and it was AMAZING! I cant even remember what we ordered but everything we got was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! our waiter was great. So friendly and engaging. His recommendations were fantastic. The view was spectacular. We went at night  and a true professional he was.  Sometime you have an experience that you know will be burned in your memory for a long time... this was one of them.  Thank you Luis and DPOV for making our anniversary such a great one." I simply cannot review this place because it's too amazing. This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down. Verdict:  I'd love to bring the wife here in the future for a meal and view!  Hoping to come back soon!"  and the meal was divine. I have a gluten allergy and they could not have been more helpful It was such a fantastic experience from start to finish I really think this is one of those places every Phoenician must go at least once. Great food  a wonderful evening with my Love and an excellent dining experience."  it's been a special occasion and the staff has always done something personalized for us to make the night special. We got to meet Chef Anthony and he even made a special surprise appetizer for us a few times. I brought my wife here for our first date I am so thankful to Catlyn and the staff at Different Pointe of View who played a part in my little surprise.  Thank you for helping me bring joy to two special ladies.  The way the evening went made me feel like they were just as important to the staff as they are to me.  Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by to say hello and enjoy the food for myself sweet view and great food and good wine  but there might be an event that makes it harder to get a table (as we discovered). There's a lounge downstairs that also has the beautiful view that serves appetizers."  I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."  I dined here with a party of seven on a very special occasion for me.  I have been taking ""out of town guests""  here for many years.  Our server for the evening was Ian and he performed in an exemplary manner as expected.  Unknown to me Probably not a place I'd go back to but those who like gourmet with fantastic views will enjoy it here." The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line "One of the best views ever. We sampled a few of the cocktails and the lounge food. The scallops were amazing. We tried two of the salads  and will definitely come back for another special occasion dinner."  especially if you get to have dinner on the patio. The service and food were very good. Go early to the bar before dinner so you can see the sunset behind the mountains... Breathtaking! Dinner for two with a bottle of wine  we went to the Terrace for drinks/apps which is just one floor below and has the same identical App menu. We sat on the patio there & had a great time. We went upstairs for our dinner at 0730. I had the salad with blood orange vinagraitte which was delicious and then I had the filet and my friend had the hanger steak. My steak was delicious. It came with something weird on the side that I didn't care for  especially if you are staying at the resort and have budgeted for an expensive night out.  I would (That's not the double Maker's on the rocks talking!)" 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ I'm not sure why I'm not giving it 5 stars but it certainly deserves the 4 I'm giving it.  Probably because of the price  the clams are huge!! It's a nice place to take love one to see the sunset while enjoying dinner up on the mountain."  and it was perfect! The coffee crusted pork tenderloin and the veal osso bucco were both delicious. The apples on the rocks and the brownie desserts were great finishers to a perfect meal. We were staying at the adjacent Hilton hotel Would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a romantic dinner spot in the Phoenix area." Our wait staff was professional and efficient. No  and a goat cheese dip so that was also fantastic. My only complaint was that the entrees were a little hum drum. I had the hangar steak and my friend had the pork and both were just lacking in overall flavor and both were a little on the dry side (and I ordered mine medium so that's not really expected). Had it not been restaurant week This is a wonderful date night restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again  I had the chocolate espresso cup for dessert which had homemade espresso ice cream on a rich chocolate cake with marscapone cheese...wonderful. We enjoyed a great bottle of Chardonay that remained chilled during our dinner tableside. After dinner "I could not believe I have not been to this place before. I have lived in AZ most my life and can say I don't always give restaurants at a hotel a chance. I went during restaurant week and was able to sample a few of the restaurants best dishes. I was blow away! Not only was the food amazing I was a guest at the resort. My girlfriend and I decided to book reservations for this restaurant. We were told our reservations would be at 800pm but when we arrived at 745pm they were changed without warning. After waiting 45 mins the hostess  let us know our table was ready. Then after walking up to the 3rd floor we were told by someone else that it would be another couple minutes. I understand its an experience but waiting 1 hour for a table when you have reservations is absolutely unprofessional especially for a half empty restaurant. When we finally were about to be seated the hostess asked me to take off my hat. I looked around there were people in shorts and T-shirts and I can't wear a hat. Already upset by the poor first impression I walked out before I was seated. The staff I encountered were rude and arrogant. Terrible experience and I will never go back. We were both in heaven when we left and almost needed to be wheeled out since we were so full! I highly recommend them for your next evening out! So good!" The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny. The waiter I had was a bit of a prick and I was forced to pay him basically a 40% tip. I dined in a party of 6 and they add a service charge on top of a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. It's ridiculous and so not worth going to. I'm from LA so seeing overly priced food with so so service doesn't get high marks from me. I won't be coming back. You're really just paying for the view. I am so disappointed with this place. "I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty  ""You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee."" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it. My one complaint: the clam broth was underseasoned. Seems like small potatoes to me."  we realized this is a place we can't justify coming back to It was fun to try something new  I had the chef special which was giant scallops and prawns on bamboo risotto. The scallops and prawns were perfectly cooked and seasoned  you will have a stellar view over downtown Phoenix.  The wine steward was very helpful in helping us choose a wine that paired well with our meals.  We tried the spare rib ravioli for our appetizer.  The ravioli was good and the corn relish that accompanied the ravioli was sweet and creamy.  I had the filet and my husband had the pork.  My filet was cooked to temperature and the horseradish sauce and white bean puree that accompanied the dish were delightful.  Every bite melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish was also splendid and cooked to perfection.  We had the ""turtle"" dessert that was on the sweet side Summary - This is a great place for a date night. It's romantic  the restaurant allows you to go out to the patio and take photos or just take in the magnificent view" "Wow! what a lovely evening! Breathtaking views of the Valley coupled with innovative cuisine beautifully prepared and presented. Went with the recommendation of the waiter and ordered the pork belly appetizer. Although it wouldn't have been something I would have chosen We come back every year to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The view is incredible and the food and service are just as good. Bill was a great host like always and we look forward to our next trip. I had the Filet and my wife had the hanger steak - I would recommend both entrees. Don't miss out on a drink and view at the Terrace Room!"  my desert of choice was chocolate  turtle. Service was excellent and people friendly. Great place for a romantic dinner and afterwards you can enjoy the outside terrace one floor down with their beautiful firepit and warm comfortable seating. Their you can enjoy the stars as well as the city lights and snuggle next to your loved one while enjoying your favorite drink. Good place to get back on track if you lost your way. WORTH IT" I am a fan and I will go again!" 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ "First time to Phoenix and couple in plane seats next to us recommended we check out DPOV. So we made 5pm reservations on Sat night. We were blown away. Top shelf wine  I would go back in a heartbeat for the view alone! We sat outside both nights (October) and were blown away by the breath-taking view of the city. So romantic. You have to try this place!!!"  it was well worth coming here.  We'd definitely come here again in the future if the occasion arises!" I have been to many great restaurants and this meal ranked in the top 20 of all-time. We had the tasting menu and I highly recommend it. Great restaurant with a fantastic view1  it was great. Take your loved one to this restaurant for great food and the experience. Definitely one of a kind in Arizona." Great food... great view. Very apt for special occasions. My hubby took me there for my birthday and made it very special. A must visit.  and our waiter and sommelier truly acted as if they were happy to be serving us. We were tended to often "Hostess rudely cut us off on the stairs. Waiter talked over us. Mentioned food allergy yet had food served that we are highly allergic to (but I fortunately noticed before it was consumed). Under par for what you pay for and would expect from the Hilton. On the bright side "This was a treat a fiesta in my mouth with delicious. ""All shit was good"" it was good from start to end. Would love to come here again and try the chief specials. Very nice chief The food and service were excellent. The view and atmosphere are incredible. A must see if you are in the area. Perfect spot for a romantic night."  the food is even better worth dying and coming back for. The lobster was so tender and flavorful along with the filet mignon. The service ""Ian"" was truly amazing  but worth it! The food was prepared and deilvery to perfection. The Lamb Loin was tender. Superb Lobster Bisque We came with a party of seven and we got a table with a gorgeous view. We had our appetizers and while we were waiting for our entrees our server recommended that we go outside and look at the view.. I didn't know that was a cue and my fianc proposed here! I couldn't be happier! It was a beautiful view  and probably one of the most romantic restaurants I have ever been to. We ate very late and the servers were so sweet and not rushing us at all. Short ribs appetizer was particularly memorable. Definitely recommend for a special occasion or just an unforgettable dinner!"   what a great place to relax and sip on some wonderfully prepared cocktails with your significant other.  The food is always something special Oh and P.S.- we're going back tonight for a wedding. Muahahahahaha. Round 2 suckaaaaz!"  and can't believe I didn't review it.  Have been talking about it ever since and have sent several people here-all said the same things about it.  Great food "This place gets a 5 star in a heart beat. Absolutely romantic restaurant at the very top of a mountain in Phoneix. It gives you a breathtaking view of the city. Beautifully decorated patio area  all around - and everything was prepared / showed well and tasted great. Prices are on the higher side but the overall experience is worth it." Horrible experience for such a special occasion."  as we savored the special meal and continued to enjoy the beautiful evening. Different Pointe of View is a gem!"  great views. Clearly I have run out of things to say." Called to make a reservation. The girl put me on hold for 15 minutes and forgot about me. I hang up and call back. She checks and nothing available that day. Thanks for wasting my time on hold. If service is like this girl on the phone I will pass on this restaurant!  unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable  great view and good food. The customer service is top notch too." So I guess that is how they make a little extra."  presentation and the view.  My wife and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed their gourmet  duck dish and a fabulous creme brle  for dessert.  Service was impeccable!"  which was perfect because we got to watch the whole city transform from day to night from up above.  As expected  food below average for what i expect & service was poor."  the high expectations of good food due to such beautiful view did not work for us Decent service. Overpriced drinks- Minty mountain spice and seasonal buck are very good. Kobe sliders were cool like they sat out not very appetizing but the fries were fantastic. View well worth a visit for just a drink or apps. We will likely be back soon!" Romantic atmosphere with a gorgeous view.  I highly recommend the Chef Menu with the wine pairing. My husband and I have gone there for our anniversary twice now and it exceeded our expectations on both occasions. The wait staff are top notch and enjoy discussing each course and wine pairing. If you truly enjoy fine dining you will love this restaurant! "I took my girlfriend here about a year ago when I first asked her to be my girlfriend.  At the time the food was amazing and the view was about as good as it gets.  The price I remember was pretty reasonable.  Honestly "You can't beat this place for the views.  Beautiful location and the city lights make it enjoyable.  The food was very well prepared and delicious.  Service was slow and had to track down our waiter to get the check.  Waited too long... Overall  great experience and we'll definitely come again."  it was unbelievably delicious. CHEF ANTHONY stopped by at the table and his personality was uplifting just like the food. Zee the manager that night was very hospitable. My friends and I had one of the best dining experiences of our lives.  We will definitely come back and tell all our friends. I saved the best for last. You can see the whole Phoenix Skyline. The views are breath taking. Wall to wall windows surround the restaurant on top of a mountain. At night  great experience and we will come again."  we went outside to look at the city lights. It made me BREATHLESS! I fell in love with the scenery. This is definitely a night I will never forget :) Beautiful sightings and wonderful delicious food. What more can you ask? :D"  and we received it. The food was visually stunning and quite tasty. It was a bit expensive. If you are going to have a drink and some wine with dinner The August issue of Wine Spectator is out and Different Pointe of View was awarded a Best of Award of Excellence.  Congrats!  service and views in all of AZ.  The view alone from the restaurant is enough to trump most establishments here in the Valley.  If you are looking to take your significant other on an anniversary  but we were stuffed!  So we moved outside and just enjoyed the view with our cocktails for a little while.  I can't wait to go back!"  but the real star is the view - best spot for date night in the valley." Different Pointe of View will always hold a special place in my heart."  as if I was sucking that gooey stuff straight from the lobster's head Possibly a slightly off night." Great place to dine!  Amazing views and really good food :)  and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier. At the end of the meal we wanted to get a picture so we went to the floor below the restaurant to take a picture and the two servers acted like it was such a kink in their schedule to take one picture of us. All in all the food  French fries.... So hard to pick knowing that the view is gorgeous." Have a special dinner coming up?  Try Different Pointe of View Had a great time. The view was fantastic. 5 course meal was awesome. Can't wait to come back. Top notch! I could sit on the patio all day before the Mosquitos starting attacking lol"  and service. The Hanger Steak was cooked to perfection and the risotto was a great addition. I tried my wife's pork tenderloin and it was just as good as the steak. We ended up eating off each other's plates. We were not disappointed and would come back. (They did lose our reservation  very serene--not cheap as my martini was like $13 or so--but so worth it just for the view and sitting pleasure." We are vacationing here from Miami. Needless to say we know good food. This restaurant was impeccable. From the amazing food to the super friendly service...5 stars all the way!! Beautiful views this is a great place to enjoy dinner with someone special or even a group of people.  Also a great place to just go have drinks at. The views are breathtaking.  ordered the five-course chef tasting with wine pairing. View was amazing. Service was perfect We decided to do the brunch on Thanksgiving Day. Turned out to be a great choice. We had a table with a great view of the valley. The food was superb. Best prime rib at a buffet I've ever had. Great shrimp and snow crab claws. Service was excellent. Definitely recommend DPOV for special events.  and I love fish. Our server noticed we weren't really eating it and ask us what was wrong. We told him and they actually gave the meals for free. Love that kind of service. I usually don't send food back or complain It is pricy. What restaurant with outstanding view Especially by Louis. Worthy place to enjoy your anniversary. Scenic view of the Phoenix city...!!" "One of the best dinning experiences of my life.  My wife and I recently went to celebrate of 4th wedding anniversary.  We were greeted so warmly when we checked in with the hostess and it seemed every one on the staff was aware of our special day.  Our waiter was very attentive  the view was magnificent. What more can you say  I always have next year!" "We came here to celebrate my dad's birthday.  I planned the seating time to coincide with sunset and that was GLORIOUS.  With all the vivid colors of the sun setting and seeing the city come to life  there is nothing wrong with the food here but we didn't walk away thinking that we had experienced a supremely talented chef." It is an up-scale fine dining restaurant with breathtaking views of the city. The service is timely and professional. The food was remarkable  but i'm assuming they're charging for the ""experience"". I got the Chicken and risotto. Babe got the scallops & said they were good. We both tried the lobster bisque and it was extremely rich I won't go back.  I would have had a better meal at many other restaurants I can think of.  The view and service are nice to haves - but the food is paramount - and for what you're charging  & Different Pointe of View.  Different Pointe of View would come in second to Tomasos.. but just because I am italian and love pasta :-)   If I am to be in PHX again  with wine's from Italy's Tedeschi Wines. Reservations can be made by calling (602) 866-6350."  I didn't know the restaurant had only one banana for all the deserts that evening at least that is what it felt like I got about a 1/4 cup of something that resembled chocolate and had heavy cream in it with 2 small slices of bananas on top it was a joke and they charged $10.00 for that. My husbands was just as small and lacked any flavor other than Chocolate  along with great service!  If the food were just a bit more exceptional  and I just don't get it.  How anyone could leave hungry after a starter and entre is truly beyond me.  I also don't get the reviewers who complained about the prices.  Yes  no one from the service staff offered to politely  refill our wine glasses something that we noticed at several tables- next the main course was brought out again to me first  Richard W all were outstanding. I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars but several of our courses (Appetizer and entrees) were way too salty. I do not know what it is about chefs these days but they need to learn that less is more. Food would have been great with MUCH less salt. Not sure I would return. Just not healthy or tasty."  that's the reason I decide to go there on our anniversary 2/5" The risotto is absolutely amazing!"  amazing service from Lenny and delectable food. A great way to celebrate my fiancees birthday. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."  we ordered the ravioli and arugula salad and for the entrees I ordered the shrimp and with black rice and my boyfriend ordered the sea bass. We both cleared our plates. My shrimp was season and cooked perfectly and his fish was very fresh tasting. For dessert we ordered the creme brle and we were fighting over it! It was that good! Since it was my birthday they brought out a rich chocolate cake and that was delicious as well. All in all I enjoyed my visit. I will definitely come back before my next birthday! Will recommend."  the arugula apple was better than the endive (too salty - I am all for bacon but it could have been incorporated more tactfully).  Her scallop entree was very good.  My sea bass was just not flavorful.  Cooked correctly 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ We went for drinks what a fun a beautiful atmosphere.  We very much enjoyed the ambiance it was very special.  I wish they would open for lunch!  the food! I had the New York strip steak and it was AMAZING. The dessert is another story. I have never had a dessert like this. We had the 31 year old creme brle and let me just tell you...GET IT. Of course  perfectly cooked but I had so much going on my plate my taste buds were confused.  The sauce that came with the okra was extremely strong flavored as well as the olive tapenade on top of the scallops.  Bacon does not always go on everything.  I had to scrape all the topping off my scallops to actually taste them.  The dessert was ordinary and dry.  Loved the staff." This spot deff has the right name. And deff the view is just breathtaking. A perfect spot for a romantic special night...We got the lobster biscuit and sausage ravioli and hands down it was great. However the portion size are a little small in my opinion. The service was on point. And the view was amazing. Absolutely breath taking views with amazing food! Our waiter was great his name was Ian (he looked exactly like Billy Campbell). I would recommend doing a reservation between 6:30 and 7:00 that seemed to have been the perfect time. We ordered the bass and pork tenderloin and both were amazing. Also had the goat cheese potatoes as our side (Ian let us substitute) and a side order of the gnocchi (which I'm still drooling over). Then for dessert we had this amazing cinnamon pudding sponge cake with ice cream and it was delicious! I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend this restaurant! "Dinner and service was amazing! Had a great deal which was a 3 course meal for 44 dollars. I got lobster bisque which was to die for   ravioli and all top notch.  I had arugula salad with apples also good.  Wife had scallops for dinner and said best in recent memory.  And she is picky.  I had filet which was perfect.  Also best in recent memory.  Everyone raved on the dessert too. Reasonable prices I thought for location. Areas to sit outside on edge of mountain.  A must try." I can imagine this to be a great place for someone who wants to rest after a stressful day and watch the city lights from a place tucked away on a mountain - and doesn't mind spending minimum $65 per person.  Maybe it is a good idea to check if the pork 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ The food is amazing. The portions seem small to anyone not used to more up-scale dining  I expect a server to be kind and friendly. Our server was rude and not too pleasant. The food was great (servings very small though). Pricey! The view was excellent though. A great place to be around sunset. :)"  the lobster was fresh and you get that buttery fresh flavor very delicious. We didn't feel that the wonton/dumpling was complimenting the dish though  and great food BUT it had to be knocked down a star because while the food IS good... the prices are astronomical.  If you want to go for just the view- I suggest going to the lounge one level below and having cocktails and appetizers."  give them a lump of crap call it pt they won't know the difference how can you give this place 5 stars when all you wrote about was how bad this place was. Helllo  1 star = bad 5 star = good"  which makes you wonder if you're missing something that others have figured out..."  we walked out onto the patio and enjoyed the view of the lit up city. If you want a dining experience that will bring happiness to your stomach and enjoyment to your heart Food was delicious. The prefix menu was hard to beat in terms of price and had plenty of items to choose from. View was amazing. Our server Luis was very helpful and entertaining.  We will definitely be back for future special occasions.  but your server will let you know. Our daughter had the steak fillet with fries and omg it was really good too lol. The presentation was beautiful as well. Thank you for making my husband's 29th wonderful." Simply amazing. Breathtaking views. Excellent service. The food was incredible and best of all the now fianc said yes. Be prepared for the price but I guarantee you will not be disappointed. They even gave us free champaign and dessert. Will definitely be back for our 1 year anniversary. Four stars or four diamonds either way this place is amazing. I couldn't imagine a more enjoyable meal. We had the best service the best food. Great pairing of wines. I can't wait to come back.... lobster bisque must have Took my girlfriend there for her birthday and she totally loved it. The food was awesome and the service was on point. The view was worth every penny Amazing view you can see whole city specially if your there at night. Have to call and reserve a table outside they only have a couple available for outside seating. Food was small portions  but DELICIOUS!!!!  i recommend the monkish with the artchioke really good. Gentleman this is a panty dropper you take a woman here Have a cocktail one level below at the cocktail lounge and soak in the view.  Let the stress dissipate and enjoy the company you're with."  was not. We had an older gentleman with white hair as our server who nearly ruined the experience for us. As I stated before the online menu for restaurant week is not accurate...I had chosen DPOV because it claimed to be serving duck confit (best thing I've ever ate). This was not the case and when my husband went out on a limb just to make sure we couldn't order it our server said ""not if you want restaurant week!"" okaaaay....understandable but maybe approach it diferently (ie. 'unfortuantely it's not one of the featured items OR I could do that for an extra sur-charge'). We ordered our starters and entrees Went Saturday night for restaurant week menu.  Food was good and view great.  Unfortunately we had a waiter  that was so hyper he basically ruined the evening.  From the minute we sat down he was in our faces talking a mile a minute and rather condescending. Thanks to the busboy for filling water glasses and bringing bread-he was professional and polite. When we left I mentioned to the hostess the odd behavior of the waiter and she knew immediately who I was talking about.  They really need to reevaluate their personnel.  We dropped over $300 and expect a lot better experience.  best dish  would be duck confetti. Nice place to go on a date." 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ  service was just ok. We had reservations for 6 and didn't eat until 7 with no one in the restaurant. The experience was just average overall. One thing I did not like was when we checked out the server added 15% gratuity to our bill. We are usually 20% tippers even if the service is average so not sure why it was done for a party of 2. Would not go back." "Amazing view and the food was truly delicious. The service could have been stronger...it was not on par with the quality or price of the food We love eating outside when the weather is right and Different Pointe of View is our favorite. The chef's tasting menu option is the best! Our only complaint is that their selections for restaurant week could be better. Overall one of the best dining experiences in the valley. "The view is amazing and we were lucky to be there in time to watch the sun go down. We chose to eat outside which was taking a chance because when the sun went down it got cold pretty fast. I would have thought they would have had some heaters outside. Both the service and food were outstanding. We never felt rushed and we were given great suggestions for food. We also received information about the mountains and areas around the property. The restaurant is high up the hill so make sure you keep following the signs to the restaurant. There is also a great lounge area and we were planning on having an after dinner drink there but it was so cold inside  excellent food choices and a very hard working friendly staff.  The entire evening was enjoyable."  I didn't want to leave. It is a beautiful romantic spot and we will definitely be returning Remember that dining should be a great experience and in my ""point of view"" this' Point of View' checked all the boxes."  I think) was wonderful. He was knowledgeable about wines as well as everything on the menu including the special of the day. One of the reasons I picked this place is because they have several gluten free items from which to choose. First Downstairs they have a bar/lounge with comfortable seating where you can order drinks/appetizers and enjoy the view. There's also a fire pit which is nice if it's a little chilly. Drinks and food are pricey and you're definitely paying for the ambience. Very romantic spot but next time I may opt for the lounge."  and was not disappointed. Service and food was amazing!! And the beautiful view of Phoenix at night was incredible. Definitely coming back. Would love to thank our waiter Luis for an amazing service. He went over and beyond to make this celebration memorable. Thank you Luis  for me.  The view is to die for.  And the service was excellent.  :)" 3cR6U4jdc5H24SKgTSgZ-A  & the atmosphere!  I had the lobster bisque- it was out of this world!!  So full of flavor & yumminess!!  I also had the black rice and shrimp- I was full!!  The shrimp were cooked to perfection!  Their butter had apple flavor to it- made dinner rolls more  scrumptious. Darrren Very romantic and elegant place. Enjoyed a 4 course meal on New Years Eve. Not only do you enjoy the amazing food but the view is also breathe taking. We will definitely be coming back here! 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ My favorite part about my first experience at Different Pointe of View was that the food was just as incredible as the view. My wife took me for my birthday and it was a first for us both. We went at night and had a great table w/ a view. The service was incredible as well. My wife and I both started w/ a bowl of Lobster bisque and we both had the Filet Mignon w/blue cheese and a reduction sauce that was phenomenal. We had Zero complaints and the satisfaction of the moment left little room for words. We added a few cocktails to top it all off. I would definitely recommend dining here.  white truffle risotto and oysters were the selections. Followed by our delectable entrees! The short ribs were out of this world and the Steelhead w/shrimp risotto was melt in your mouth. Followed by a special anniversary dessert and we added the creme brle-delicious! The service of the waitstaff was impeccable; This was definitely a 5-star experience and will return!"  the service was some of the best I ever experienced. I never had to look for my waiter. My water glass was always full. And the staff offered to take photos of us several times in different settings. Even took us outside and took a photo of us with the view behind us. I would absolutely return and would absolutely recommend this place to my friends. Of course  was very knowledgable in the wine department as well. He offered food and drink suggestions we couldn't be happier with. Most important they had my favorite dish... Pork belly!  Melt-in-your-mouth perfection. To cap it off Compliments to the chef and the entire staff at Different Pointe of view...I look forward to the next time I'm lucky enough to return!" I am a fairly regular customer of the Different Pointe of View but they regularly close the restaurant for major events like weddings or company sponsored events.  Tonight was a good example. Although it was a Tuesday and closed there were no signs telling visitors or guests the restaurant was closed to the public. If you have every been to this restaurant you would know it is a long drive up a steep hill for quite some distance. Once you get there again no sign or anything to tell you the place is reserved or closed to the public. It is only when you try to enter they tell you that you can't enter. Tonight I brought a friend who just moved to Phoenix to show them the restaurant and bar area.  I was told very rudely that I could not go in and was not able to show my friend the restaurant. I explained that I did not want to enter the restaurant or terrace area bit just show them the facility. Very disappointed in the lack of courtesy or at least a sign to show the place is reserved. Welcome to Phoenix and the Hilton Hotel. "I'd first off like to say that my experience at this beautiful restaurant was amazing. Amazing waiter and amazing service. The food was great I had the chicken Fulton Short ribs were best I've ever had! Not to mention the view is spectacular. This was the best restaurant I've ever had the opportunity to try! Highly recommended. Came here recently for an anniversary. Would have given the place 5 stars but my boyfriend called a month in advance to get a window seat to enjoy the views and they did not deliver on that. Anyways with that being said the food and service was great. The views are to die for and was definitely a memorable experience. For a high end restaurant the prices are affordable at like 25-40$ generally per entre. We will be back again! 3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ I'd defiantly go back to enjoy drinks "My wife and family planned a surprise dinner for my birthday. I thought it was the two of us but it ended up as 8 including my daughter who flew in from Seattle. The setting was incomparable with exquisite views of nighttime Phoenix! The setting I went out to a dinner here about 9 years ago. My only problem that I still have with this place was the quality of the actual beef. Or maybe how it was cooked in not to sure. The texture.... I'm not sure. But I still crave that stupid steak from this place. I have traveled the world several times and have dined at many fine restaurants. This one takes the bees knees."  well it feels like that. The food was really good from what I remember but the view is even better. It is little expensive but it's worth it on special occasions.  It's not very easy to find the restaurant or parking since its in the back section of the complex. After I was told that it was nice/casual and felt underdressed when I arrived.  The staff were gracious and kind.  A great experience."  and the pork tenderloin. Holy cow the food (all of it) was absolutely amazing. Even the bread along with the three different dips for it was delicious.  We shared all of our dishes and everything was melt in your mouth good and succulent.  The pork belly really did melt in your mouth and the sauce..oh my we were fighting (playfully) over dipping our bread in the sauce. My steelhead trout was the best I have had to date. I was so full but I made sure to eat every last bite (my stomach was not happy with me). All the other ladies throughly enjoyed their meals as well. How we actually had room for dessert I still have no idea but we all took one for the team and ordered dessert as well. I was surprised with a happy birthday creme brulee from the chef which was just as heavenly as the rest of my meal. The wine  and the food is amazing. I took my parents here on our vacation and they were extremely impressed. I would hands down suggest this for a special occasion or just a nice night out. If you're not interested in eating Perfect date night/celebration spot!! The steak was perfectly cooked and the risotto makes for a perfect appetizer. There's truly nothing like it in the Phoenix area. "It's been years since I have been here and there food is still amazing.   Great views My only qualm was that for such a nice restaurant you could at least serve warm bread." Fantastic view of downtown. Great service. Highly recommend. Had a lovely evening for my wife's birthday. "Maybe the best oysters I have ever had.   Would think about coming back to Phoenix just to go and eat them again.   Everything was excellent The view was also breath taking.  It was a perfect evening to celebrate the beauty of our relationship.   If you want to experience something heavenly you should really give Different Pointe of View a shot. I don't think you will be disappointed!!!"  but did not seem up to par for the elegance of the restaurant. I would still go back and give it another try."  and a tomato based spread as well.  The bread is not warm though.  They could improve in this area.  An olive oil with Mediterranean herbs would have been a nice option in the trio.  Luis also brought out a small shot glass like container for each of us to sample their lobster bisque.  WOW!  It is heavier and very creamy.  I kind of wished I had ordered it as an appetizer.  In my past DPOV visits This is shocking customer service coming from a resort with multiple 4 diamond ratings." Excellent meal with lovely views. Duck confit with risotto was delightfully crispy and flavorful. My husband enjoyed a perfectly cooked fillet. Wonderful place for a special occasion. We'll be back!  outstanding food quality combines to make this well worth the trip.  Highly recommended." Different Pointe of View is the restaurant that makes you feel like every meal is the best meal you've ever had. The service and waitstaff are impeccable and impressively knowledgeable on wine pairings to create the perfect blend of flavors for even the most discerning of palates. The beautiful mountain and city views only enhance an already wonderful experience. Highly recommend!  and went down a level to check out the beautiful fire feature. I'd definitely recommend this place for a special occasion... it was a lovely way to wish our friends well before their move!" This place was amazing. View spectacular and the food and service top notch. Overall a really great experience that comes with a spectacular view. A little pricey but that's to be expected."  service and views. Hard to beat. This is our favorite ""high-end"" restaurant in the valley."  even came out to our table to greet us. The old saying is ""never trust a skinny chef."" Trust THIS one! From this culinary experience at Different Point of View Great venue for a romantic sunset dinner.  Glass of wine outside during sunset and greay city views during dinner.  Great menu and service.  Catered to a special menu request above and beyond.  Thanks  you could tell the chef is amazing with his pairings and preparations .. I had the scallops which were the size of my head lol and my husband had an amazingly marinated and flavorful filet that was prepared to perfection ... What can I say even my vegetables tasted incredible like they were marinated before hand . The staff was on top of everything .. Took away my plate I said thank you .. ""With pleasure"" the bus boy states "" no really thank you"" I say "" no no it's my pleasure o love to clean"" he says lol what a great staff very on point and ready to cater to your ever need. The  architecture is very beautiful .. So after dinner we decided to visit the many fountains and check out the scenery . We just had a really great time on the rare occasion that we do go out . Thank you Different Point of View for the beautiful evening ."  one of the top dates of all time."  this restaurant is fantastic in terms of the service setting and views (they have a lovely and large patio that is great for after dinner pictures  decent place. Excellent views. Good service. No complaints. It's a bit pricey but you're splurging. Is what it is." Kinda challenging to find  Tomato Infused Grilled Bistro Steak. My boyfriend and I both got the Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crme Brle and Devil's Delight. I recommend anyone to go at least once if you have the opportunity as you will not be disappointed! On top of that  but they tasted just as bad. They were either extremely freezer burnt or the breading was not supposed to be on a mozzarella stick. The pizza was jusok but not great. The cheese ravioli with meat sauce looked like it had dog food for meat sauce. I feel sick just thinking about what I just ate. I think they just ruined Streets of NY for me for life I will definitely return to this location  so the occasional lunch is easy. If you're in the area  he brought me to my table and before you new it my drink was ready & order being giving to the kitchen. the server was very attentive i found out because i guess he saw me looking at my watch and new i had a time limit to get back to work do to when the food came quickly so did my check. He politely said it was for my conveinance incase i was on a lunch break. I was amazed!! he also asked me for my name since he had never seen me there before and made me feel very welcome. I ended up going back to work very satisfied and planned on returning to the streets again on my next lunch break to enjoy another exsperience with that server named Jon" "Love this place! A group of us (8-10 guys) have tried 3 different SoNY stores. This one really works thanks to Danni. She really knows how to be attentive. We come in every other Thursday and are THRILLED when we see her waiting our table. Hard to believe  the only reason to get pizza from this over-priced vendor is that they are open on Sunday until 9pm. You wont hate the food "The food is good since I am a major pizza fan.  However had the pizza a while back... not impressed.  spinach salad awesome as are the sandwiches.   was craving lasagne and ordered it last nite.   blah!!   flavor was very blan... added my own parm & spices to mke it edible.  stick with the sandwiches and salads id you order from here "I have had food delivered a few times and each time it has been perfect.  I like that you have the option to get garlic bread and salad with your pasta entre.  The pasta dishes are delicious as are the salads and garlic bread.  Everything is very fresh.  Also the delivery person is very polite and personable.  It is a bit pricey I enjoy streets of New York pizza a lot but I do lie stumps wings just a bit more but streets has great wings to First time eating here and I ordered through delivery . Figures it has decent reviews and looked yummy I got a Greek salad and the pasta pesto after emptying one of my dressing containers I noticed a black hair in the bottom very gross I couldn't finish my food what a waste of $30 . hIe65VALe8rxseYECVj08w Ordered delivery. Chopped antipasto salad and a simple pizza. Asked for plates/utensils. Food arrived in time promised. No plates/forks. Hmmm. Food was fine but eating was adventure. "We are visiting from out of town and came across this place on Yelp.  Really good service Bad service. Out of wings... Really? Cold pizza & flat soda. Dirty bathrooms with bugs all over the floors. I sent my food back and didn't eat a thing. Very disappointed and unhappy. Nothing NY about this pie."  no great wine would have had a chance against anchovies). Now I know where to go to satisfy anchovy cravings."  Streets of New York. I hope tomorrow goes better for you than today did." "Ordered pizza from here tonight and decided to call after an hour and a half had passed by.  The girl on the phone was rude and said the pizza was already out for delivery (we live 4 minutes away) then proceeded to hang up on us mid-sentence.  We called back ten minutes later after the food had still not arrived and talked to the same girl who proceeded to put us on hold for 3 minutes.  She said she would cancel and refund the order.  I then asked nicely  Now the food still sits cold on my kitchen counter- minus the eleven wings for my refund in the morning."  my order was wrong. The pizza was missing 2 of the toppings I was charged for and was under-cooked. Additionally my salad came with the wrong dressing. The experience was disappointing. It's the small things that make a difference and Streets of New York dropped the ball tonight."   smaller ""Streets"". We stop by when in the area and hungry for Italian or pizza and wings." They said it's best to take a drink order.The little breadsticks that they gave me a delicious jso soft and cheesy.wwdgy I'm done with this place. Sorry." Just tried this place for the first time. Ordered the ultimate cheese steak. Delicious! I got it delivered. Only complaint is it was quite soggy. Whatever sauce on it that made it this way should be served on the side especially for delivery. I'd definitely eat here again though. One of the stars for the fact they brought napkins forks and condiments . Rare nowadays without requesting it.  I'm either waiting a while to be helped or my order almost seems rushed. The restaurant doesn't give off a warm welcome at all. But the cooks keep me going back lol"  she had to get a manager because ""she did not know what was going on?"" Ok whatever I thought lets just get this done I have a house full of hungry friends LOL! So it was done and they deliver- 30-45 minutes that's pretty reasonable I thought. An hour and 25 minutes later there was a knock on the door...FINALLY FOOD!!!! The delivery guy was on point he was funny and really made it a great time and his service was AWESOME. I had to tell him about the girl in the phone and I let him know how I felt he gets 10 stars out of 5 stars!  he was great even though I was complaint about his fellow co worker he was great at not throwing her under the bus and never "" agreed "" with with what i was saying but you could tell in his face this was not the first time he had heard this. He pulled out the receipt and asked is this your address I replied no and he says oh ok that explains why I was driving around and couldn't find it. Really? The girl who took the order totally go it wrong! I tipped very well and he was great! Now the food  sorry folks this place is over priced for the quality I ordered two slices and a salad the pizza was not good quality the peperoni was not good quality for the price I don't mind paying for good food but 20 bucks for poor quality no thanks wont be back.  service was good also they have other items to choose from in the menu. Its a small restaurant but nice layaout n vibe to it..they also sell slices..id come bak again.." Worst $25 I've spent in a long time." Ordered one thing- a pizza. Got there to pick it up. They got the order wrong. Then they overcharged me. Offered to give me a credit for the next time. Won't go back.  great pizza.  Simple as that. I read a lot of over the top poor reviews.  I don't think good pizza will make unhappy people happy.  Place does get pretty busy and could probably use another worker.  Guy out front was stretched pretty thin answering phones  but pricy! Delivery time was as expected.  We were in The Pointe Squaw Peak so the driver brought us plenty of plates and napkins.  Thank you!"  but it didn't knock my socks off. The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you. Maybe I should start with a plain pepperoni before going into the sausage and onion realm. Maybe I got a little crazy on my first trip. No...I don't think so plus the customer service is extremely good." My colleagues and I are definitely going back to Stumpy's to try their subs and more."  pleasant owners. Try the sliced sausage topping. The only downside is this is NOT healthy fare - I don't know what the calorie count is per slice  and it's good pizza!  Woodfire oven baked goodness!  Definitely will continue to frequent this shop - especially on nights we're too pooped to cook for ourselves.  So glad to have them around!" These people are so cool and the pizza is just solid as hell. The wings are really great too. Pizza oven baked without all that grease. Hard working good folk."  and spitting hot fire is gooooooood!  Chase and the crew rock it without even breaking a sweat.  Pizza. Wings. all great It's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home. After seeing all the other pizzas at the restaurant and imagining how they tasted Dominos except it KILLS them. can't say too much about great quality pies made at a local pizza spot "We stayed at the Hilton Squaw Peak and dug around our Entertainment book for local coupons. Stumpy's Pizza was Saturday night's winner and it was damn good. We had a B1G1 pizza so did a half & half for the first one (Medium 1/2 Hawaiian and other 1/2 canadian bacon and onions) and the other pizza Pretty good pizza. I've tried just about every pizza place around and this is in the top 5.  always listens.. which is greatly appreciated.  The pizza is always ready prompt and piping hot and fresh and they very frequently have coupons available which is an added bonus to their already reasonable prices!  Love this mom and pop!" Just go. (Closed on Sundays.)" I have a passion for great pizza.  It's been my favorite food since I was a kid. I've outgrown my fondness for the typical pep & sausage as my tastebuds have been seeking out new flavors. The first time I tried the Gourmet White Pizza at Stumpy's I believe I heard the chorus to Hallelujah! Another favorite of mine is the Hot Blue Chicken Wing Pizza...an explosion of flavorful deliciousness! So good...I am actually salivating over my keyboard just thinking about it! Anyway...Stumpy's is by far one of my most favorite pizza places. Another giant plus? The owners and staff are the most amazingly friendly people I have ever met. They greet everyone with a warm smile and a wonderful pizza!  and this one takes the cake hands down.  I think I could eat one every day.  Made with ricotta and whatever you want.  Even the marinara to dip in is extra fabulous.  Friendly staff  and the employees are always friendly!" Great pizza and wonderful staff! I love their house italian dressing for their salads! The guys that work there are very friendly and always remember the regulars and treat them like old friends. Check this place out if you're in the area  accidents are good.  Real good.  Their pizza is consistently delicious and the people who work here are always friendly.  I haven't tried anything but their pizza and it keeps us coming back.  Try it  great rock and roll. Coupons  I can honestly say Stumpy's does it RIGHT! Everything was prepared like it actually should be (like a real pizzeria) unlike these franchise pizza corporations. I have a NEW pizza spot while I'm at my girlfriends now "The best pizza I have had in a long time. I give it 4 stars because the area it is in is hard to find and somewhat shady. We ordered a pineapple I have a carryout/delivery menu from Stumpy's but it's nice to dine in or sit outside on a cool evening If you want wings and pizza try their Buffallo Bleu Cheese Pizza."  it is right off the 51 at Northern.  Highly recommend for a cheap I've never had a bad pizza. Their crumbly sausage is so good and their service can't be beat. Yummy! "This place was fantastic. First of all I placed my order online. They called me in about 30 seconds to verify the order since my zip code for the credit card was out of state. Once I got there the food was ready in the time promised (they even held it for a few minutes once he learned I would be making another stop first). I took the food back to the hotel room and it was perfect. The order details (no tomatoes  eyes big with pleasant surprise. I'll certainly go back to try other items on the menu. It's a small place and not a chain. I like that! No alcohol served and that's OK with me. Hours are Mon.-Sat. 11a-9p. Subs are $7.00 & change; pizza starts at $11.50. Employee's work well together  and fast delivery.  I'd recommend and definitely order from again.  (Please send napkins with delivery).  Did I mention the great fresh garlic?"  the best pizza in the whole Phoenix Metro area.  If you don't like this place chances are that nobody likes you and you're a complete moron.  You know who you are! Lol!" "A ""neighborhood joint"" that's closed on Sundays during football season???" UPDATE:  Stumpy's is still offering wonderful pizza and subs. They have added delivery within a certain area  inexpensive (only slightly more than chains) and the customer service was awesome.  So much personality!!!!!  They made me want to come back in her over and over again  sometimes I will spend a few return trips on one sandwich just making sure I really like it. It is worth your time to take a drive and enjoy the food  and the service and food are always consistently great. At this point This place is the bomb. Fan-freaking-tactic pizza. Truly some of the best ive ever had. The owner is a really nice lady who made my pizza herself. I would recommend this to anyone. If only I lived closer I would have it more often.  but they are churning out some huge sandwiches with quality ingredients and some delicious looking pizza.  While $9.50 including tax Had cheese and sausage with onion pizza. Crust was limp and doughy. Italian salad was average. Not my kind of pizza  and the bread was not soggy even with the extra cheese. I had a (3) slice of ""The Butcher"" pizza. Loved it. This place is extremely friendly  it's tucked away next to my dentist and doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside) but the food is delicious. Also  we won't leave without checking that we got the pizza we ordered rather than someone else's leftover pepperoni pizza  ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but Can I add 1 more star? Let's make this a 6star! Love love love.  and the prices are reasonable. The greek salad comes loaded with toppings and all the ingredients were fresh. Topping-wise Delicious.   The hot Italian sandwich on wheat with everything is the best sandwich I've ever had and I've heard others say it.  Pizza is fantasic.   The owner Chase and his wife are so friendly and so is all the staff.  and I had an excellent calzone.  Husband enjoyed the meatball sub too.  Quick I absolutely recommend trying the specialty pizzas.  This place is great and a treasure in my local area!" This place is a hole in the wall they have great pizza and salads. It was a small place but I would still say it was kid friendly. YAY !!! ITSA GOODA PIE!!" GO!  GET SOME GOOD EATS!!" This place has great pizza.  Crust not to thick.  Chewy and crispy.  Very flavorful sauce. "Food was great I would've given 5 stars but I got charged for 2 extra dressings & both were wrong. Also when I specifically ordered chx wings for my kids ""these are for my kids"" he could've told me that mild is still a little spicy. My spicy wings were great. Delivered to my hilton squaw peak room Great Pizza for the money. Love the crunchy crust. Great flavor to the sauce. I always ask for extra sauce and they add on with no problem. Only downer is there is not much room to dine in. Great dive pizza joint.  but I don't think it was amazing. The woman who took our order over the phone was very friendly though I hate giving bad reviews. Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given. I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible. Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight. Awesome. "Very Poor Customer Service Skills. Got a sandwich to go. Got all the way home to find the bottom of sandwich seeping with fluids and soggy enough bread to bait a hook! Drive back and informed them. Even though they remade the sandwich not one person offered me a discount on my next order or anything to compensate me for my additional time and inconvenience.  Generally  I love what they've done in such a tiny little shop space. This struck me immediately as an independent little neighborhood joint with pride of ownership. I just wish it was easier to spot when driving by."  fresh toppings. I loved the marguerita and my girl loved the greek. The slice and a salad combo is a great value too." kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ Ordered a takeout order online to be ready at 7:55 show up at 8:00 to pick it up and they were just putting it in the oven... It was ready at 8:20. They didn't even apologize. Overpriced for such bad service. I won't be eating here again. This is my new favorite lunch place. It is right by my new house and I am stoked to have a local go-to spot. The hot veggie sandwich is excellent and the dressing has such a savory flavor. The garlic breadsticks are some of the best I've had. Haven't had pizza yet but plan to soon. http://www.attorneysteve.net" They have a awesome spread they put on the subs too!" The pizza was hand tossed but the crust was perfectly crispy! The flavors were perfect too. I had the small which fed me (Im a big guy) but could have fed 2 people. I also had a 6 piece of hot wings which were very good! I would deffinately go back here again. Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time This is our favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Great crust and yummy toppings. Get a pizza stone and you are all set.. BillyRay"  weekly specials and neighborhood coupons. Visit enough times and they remember you by name. Dine in a lot and you and your family will get your picture on the wall. Its a small spot but has just the right amount of space." Stumpy's came thru wonderfully - the order was on time  this is my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Highly recommended!" This is a Real joint For good subs and pizza Even it diesla not have the nieces exterior appeal the delicious food makes it up  they only have pies with sauce and then they put the toppings on as you order. The pizza oven is one of those conveyor belt type which I'm not crazy about. But the slices that were coming out for other customers looks pretty delicious. I'll have to come back and try to pizza you're going to have to be pretty damn good cause I'm spoiled when it comes to pizza. So if you're in the area The staff was friendly and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Nice place to take a family." Absolutely love love love their pizza. Its some of the best pizza I have had since moving to Arizona ! The pizza was flavorful and crispy and the sub was also very good.  Sub was on fresh bread and portion size was huge - enough for 2.  This was one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted and I would order it every week if i could. STUMPY'S IS AWSOME!"  the sandwiches are great and don't forget the rice krispie treats "In town for a few days. Ate here the first 2 nights. It's that good! Go  here's $5 off your next order"" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing." "driving down northern we saw this place and decided to give it a shot. the place is VERY small inside but luckily the weather was nice so we were able to eat at a table outside.   The sauce was really good and so was the cheese I can't express how much I love this place.  Their pizza is so delicious and the customer service is excellent.  Stumpys is by far my favorite pizza place in the valley. They have a wide selection of toppings for pizza and a good variety of sandwiches if that's your thing (I'm a pizza guy  Stumpy's delivers. Which is also amazing. That is all." "Service wasn't that great. Table I sat at was dirty. It took them about 10 minutes to get me a side salad that I had ordered with a slice of pepperoni pizza. The salad had fresh ingredients. Pretty good. The pizza was alright kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ Just ate here today.  A buddy of mine took me. Great sub good pizza! service was nice too. thank guys. Don't make it to your side of town a lot but when I do Im there. kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ  the staff are friendly and helpful. Only the ambiance is a problem; it is crowded pizza joint decor and the tables are very close together. The prices are excellent given the quality. We do a Butcher's Special (meat lover) with added ricotta. It is as good a pizza as I've ever had. There is ample parking   will be back again soon!" "Just picked up my first pizza from there. 16"" The Works! Fantastic!! The whole family is hooked. Fresh  I get pepperoni and man! The toppings are SO fresh! You can also get a monster slice which is clutch during lunch. But I am writing this for their SUBS. God Bless Stumpy's and their subs! It's the mayo...believe me "I was at the American Italian club playing bocce and decided to grab a pizza on my way home. Opened up the phone to Yelp and found this place right up the street. Had good reviews so i gave it a try and was really glad I did cause this place is awesome! Got a large The Works and added the garlic and jalapeno. Was really a great pizza and everyone loved it. Next time I tried the Whiteout On another night I went to SNY just to get some variety and perspective on Phx area pizza and it was a total let down. Stumpys was closed so I had no choice but next time  but man! It's one of the best little hole in the wall places in that area! I wouldn't call the food good...I would call it addicting! I can't wait to go back there with my man! If you haven't gone there "A local eatery recommended by a neighboring business. I tried to order two slices to go and was told all slices are made to order; no ready made pizzas;  please choose from the menu. Hmm. Waited approximately 8 minutes and boy was it worth it!  Fresh delicious ingredients "I've eaten here a few times now and I was hooked at first bite. Everything so far has been delicious. The whiteout pizza is one of my favorites as well as the hot subs. So far I've tried the veggie and Italian. Both were awesome! I'll be coming back for more! For those ordering delivery  but definitely worth the price."  and there is something for everyone. Stumpy's is really good for their prices and I go here for a movie night or a birthday party or for a little guilty pleasure. I love The Works pizza."  just the right amount of sauce. Well done. Good price also. Service was good. Definetly recommend." I LOVE Stumpy's I have eaten here for the last 12 years and have not had one bad thing. The best thing on the menu is the hot Italian sub! Their house dressing is amazing!! Also don't forget the chocolate chip cookie; best cookie I have bought at a pizza/sub place; soft in the center and crispy on the edges.  You Gotta try it all!!  I am not interested in her perspective.  Great delivered pizza.  Wrong order.  Guest service from 17 year olds who don't give a crap  the wings are baked that's a plus ! The owner is there sometimes cooking  Stumpy's has some of the best Phoenix pizza I've ever had it's hard to find a good pizza joint and not end up going to dominoes or Pizza Hut but let me tell you ping the two extra bucks for this pizza is well worth it fresh ingredients quick service I recommend this to anyone that's in the area for lunch or dinner I've also had their subs and they're also very good I find this a great choice for pizza and I hope hope their dishes are as good as the pizza The pizza is awesome! The chef salad was great! Only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because when I was ordering on the phone it was unorganized and a long wait to order and a really long delivery time. I ended up just picking it up and that was fine. Nice people but not great on the phone. But the pizza made up for all that! Glad I yelped this place.  but very close and comparable to the pizza I grew up eating. For a great price this is definitely my go-to neighborhood pizza and sandwich place!" One of the best Pizza's I've had. It's a small place - only a couple of tables - Carry Out is their main business. Medium Wings were great also and Fresh Salad. Wish they had real dishes and utensils though - I don't like all that Styrofoam - maybe they could find a more eco-friendly product. Best subs in Arizona!! Get the Italian classic with habenaro mayo!! Omg! Sooo good! The service is awesome and fast! Pizza is spot on as well!! Don't think just go to stumpys! "Very disappointed ordered a pizza and never got it Stopped here and got the to slice meal of pepperoni and bacon. The pizza was awesome in the staff was friendly and helpful. please open one of these in Gilbert!! "This place has no kidding the best sandwiches I've ever had. My favorite is the Bigger Dipper with chipotle mayo. So remarkably good I can't stop ordering it! The Italian Me and my husband just had dinner here this evening. We walked in and everyone behind the counter was busy. But they weren't busy enough to greet us when we walked in. We took a look at their menu and decided we would share a medium pizza. We ordered the butcher pizza which had all the meats on it. I must say that the pizza was GOOD! The crust could be a little thinner and a little more sauce could be added. Then it would have been a GREAT pizza. The Italian sausage was very good along with the rest of the meats actually. I heard about this place from a friend of ours. We had just purchased a house in the area and was told by him to give it a chance. I'm glad we did as it was only $21 dollars for the medium butcher and 2 medium drinks. We can't wait to try out their delivery service since we are only 5 blocks away. Thank you stumpy's for a great first experience at your establishment. Ws Wings outta this world!! Pizza was delicious but the topping can easily slip right off the crust Love this place I had their pizza for the first time about 2 months ago when a friend ordered through delivery.  I ordered from here at least once a week I only wish they delivery area covered more of the Downtown Phoenix area. "We ordered Stumpy's for delivery last night based on a coupon we had. Ordered one pepperoni pizza to be delivered about one mile. They told us it would be about 45 minutes to an hour. At an hour and 20 minutes we called to check status and they told us they weren't sure what was going on or where their driver was. They told us they would give a discount on the next order. The driver showed up at the two hour mark with our pizza. The pizza was okay Pizza is my favorite food so I know what im talking about - try stumpys!" Everything smelled wonderful and we drooled over a couple of sandwiches we saw. Our pie came quickly and was just the right size for sharing. The crust was crispy with a chewy-ness - not quite a thin crust but not a thick crust either. The flavor of the sauce was good Employees lack personality." "Been looking for  real NY style pizza.  I found it at Stumpys.  Sauce is delicious!! Spicy BBQ wings are great!! They are baked not fried!! Prices are reasonable!! Busy place  food was good but unfortunately I didn't get my whole order. Supposed to get 24 wings and they only sent 12. I've called about 8 times and no answer. Never ordering delivery again "Love this place!  I have been coming here for years now. Pizzas are fantastic and the staff is extremely friendly and fun!  If you're tired of trendy fads and are just craving a good old fashion mom and pop hearty pizza that out of this world "We ordered delivery while staying at a resort near here. Got the barbecue chicken pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both were fantastic  half Greek (with sausage sprinkled ax the entire pie) as well as breadsticks and hot wings. Everything was delicious!!"  but now two weeks later and still no refund. Then to find out he's been on vacation so that must mean he forgot.. I basically said I would stop by in person tomorrow and expect my refund in person. Not only have I had to deal with awful customer service "Pizza crisp was amaz-balls. We also ordered The Works which the kids liked better.  I am from El Paso and we aren't really a pizza city so I may be easily impressed? But definitely recommend this place. Call in your delivery order  and they offer counter service and are very friendly. I use to live close enough for delivery "We were staying at the Hilton for the weekend and found Stumpys on Yelp and decided to try it out.  I was impressed with the online ordering as it was easy to order and allowed me to choose the time I wanted to take delivery of dinner.  It was 3 pm at the time of my order and I specified 5 pm for the delivery.  This would give them plenty of time to plan to get my order on time.  At 5:35 there was a knock at the door and it was the Stumpys delivery guy.  He handed us a few bags and brought out a pizza.  We ordered two large pizzas (a black olive and a ham and pineapple) and an order of 12 breadsticks.  We were given one ham and pineapple pizza Our group left all giving it 5 stars!!" We were staying at the Pointe Squaw Peak for a staycation and wanted pizza. This place came up and sounded great! Pizza was delicious and the wings were yummy! We will definitely return again :) I've been getting delicious sandwiches from Stumpy's for about 15 years now. I really love the Italian Classic and the French Dip. Stumpy's represents the regions well! Its so good that my wife makes me stop and pick up something whenever I'm in the neighborhood.  with a thin foldable crust and an interesting choice of cheese. Still not quite 5 star worthy  no concern...nothing. Won't be going back." "So good!! Very friendly staff and patrons. Everyone always seems to be a regular when you go in there. I've had their plain cheese and also a pepperoni with sausage. My New Yorker boyfriend gave his seal of approval by eating almost the whole pizza lol. We'll be ordering again for sure! Call ahead for take out. They are great I love this place. The pizza is great. Amazing calzones. I only had a sub once but it too was delicious. Not to mention the friendly staff. Everyone there has always made me feel welcome. kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ I love whole in the wall pizza joints....great slices...friendly staff...fast...and quite fulfilling "Best pizza and sub's around.  If you don't get the Italian sub you are missing out "This is the best pizza I've ever had and top 3 with wings. It's a little pricey but if you have the money you have to go. They've messed up our order twice in the over 3 years we've been going  my face is stuffed with the ""works"" pizza.....soooo good! And my husband absolutely loves the ""bob's"" wings. It's one of the best places to eat pizza in Phoenix." "The only reason that I had for stopping at Stumpy's is that it's on the way to an Xmas party where I had to bring something ""to share"".  I call ahead and by the time I'm passing by the pizza is done.  Haul it to the party and everybody's happy.  Good pizza and staff "Stumpys is the best pizza I've EVER eaten in Phoenix. Ive lived here 20 years. It is absolutely delicious. I  started a job in the strip mall and have been addicted every since. The sandwiches are also great  the location is not the best but the owner here also owns 13 North in the same little shopping center. (Go there BTW!!) I had enjoyed Stumpy's Pizza in the past but never the sub. Had an opportunity to drop in and am very glad I did. If you like a hot italian cold cut sub go get this!!" "Went here after bookmarking this place on yelp and I have to say my pizza was great. I called prior to coming to ensure they accepted Amex (which they did) even though it was a busy Friday night the woman that answered the phone was polite and pleasant. Once we arrived I order the family deal which is a large cheese pizza and 24 wings.. I added pepperoni to the entire pizza and bacon and sausage to half Their customer service is great! It was our second time there and they remember my boyfriend's last order. The cashier was very kind and helpful as well ." "I'm new to the area and the area of Phoenix that I used to live had a terrible selection of pizza delivery.  Since I've moved over here I've made it a point to take advantage of the choices I have.  I absolutely love Stumpys  that the orders I have placed have only been during the week.  She was not a good example of customer service.  The owner/manager is the only responsible party but he doesn't work past 5. So no one to talk to.  I was told that the food should be excellent.  This was the first time that the pizza was cold and the wings were soggy.  She got down to my level kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ Best Pizza around in my opinion. I order the works and the topping are awesome. The iced Tea is delicious as well. "Grabbed a pizza to go when we were staying in the area on vacation.  Pizza was very good Sorry...but my kids wouldn't even eat this pizza.  It was terrible.  A simple cheese pizza. I have been going to stumpies 4 years every time i go the pizza is always hot and fresh "We tried Stumpys after a recommendation from a friend when we moved into the neighborhood. Nothing but great things to say. The pizza is bomb "Just had the hot Club Sandwich on white. Killer. Perfectly balanced  we had a slice and side salad combo. Fresh salad with homemade ranch  friendly service. Order the pizza to go and get the wingding with mild sauce. You will not regret it." Tasty pizza! place is a little rough to get in and out of on a lunch hour though Tiny place.  Give it a try..." Small little place with awesome pizza. Cant wait to be in the area again to go there again!  good amount of sauce. My husband came back to the hotel with the yummy goodness and was stopped several times by people asking where he went. He gave them the coupons from the top of the box. I hope they got business from that. We'd definitely order from them again when in AZ." Their sliced sausage is great and sauce and cheese are perfect."   and the service was rather quick.  If you're in the area this place is highly recommended"  not the best I've ever had though. I like the option that you can either order the whole pizza or just by the slice. I was looking for a thin crust pizza so the lady recommended to order it by the slice. I built my own with pepperoni Came here from California based on other reviews online and we're pleased with the pizza the meatballs and friendliness of the staff. Would recommend anyone to Stumpys the pizza was great kids loved it "Every time we're in Arizona at the Pointe Hilton Sqaw Resort we always order Stumpy's.  They deliver to hotel  NY style slice of pepperoni heaven?  One -- Ray's on Bell Rd. & 3rd Street! If you want to feel like your walking into a pizzeria in downtown NYC  I've upped them a star because I heard through the grapevine that they've repainted and refreshed their interior. Hmmm... did someone tell them about my review?!"  Ray's delivers just that... I followed my friend's lead and blotted it a bit with a napkin before diving in and devouring my slice.  I would 100% take out from Ray's again... it was reasonably priced ($16.50 for a large - actually Been to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times."  tasty slices & I'd be pleased to enjoy another pizza I guarantee you won't feel the same way about pizza!" V3lQtk1LgwAEcF9j-BzchA  I have never not had to wait while picking up the pizza..I am not a fan of the steak sandwich Not all Ray's is the same.  This Ray's is the best pizza outside of Brooklyn.  just-sloppy-enough slices. Though I usually neglected the Ray's chains of questionable origin and quality in Manhattan in favor of other joints I liked better Excellent pizza and fantastic selection of Italian food. Prices are wonderful as well.  I have a hard time not wanting to eat Rays!" By far my favorite pizza!!! This is the best NY style pie in town.  I would give it 5 stars but they don't have free drink refills and the counter person rarely gets off of her cell phone to take your order. Ray's at 3rd St and Bell Rd can't be beat!"  don't let the cashier's New York attitude scare you off  but the service sucks. Dudes working there are really pissy pant types. Like they were doing me a favor making me that pizza and charging almost $20 for a medium veggie." "Honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about for this place rtLNlsi9vtKqwk61Y8tMpQ Don't go in expecting to get a smile out of the staff though.  I've been going there for years and they could have no teeth and I wouldn't know it." "I come here any time my wife and I are wanting some simple slices. The food is always good and cheap with the slices being huge. I usually order two forgetting just how big they are! I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the service  extra mushroom pizza and they piled on the mushrooms. It was such a relief to find a pizza place in Phoenix that resembles a good old fashioned NY pizza parlor. I will be back and am still searching for the best pizza "What more can I say.  Nice staff coupled with the best New York Style pizza in town "New York ghetto feel in a strip mall but delicious pizza!!!! Not oily and crunchy thin crust with plenty of toppings if you want. We ordered a large with jalopenos I havent met a Rays that I dont like  onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!" When I saw the $20 for $10 deal at Rays I jumped on it.  Ordered the breaded chicken w/ spaghetti dinner.  My buddy ordered the sausage hero sub.  I was amazed when they told us we needed to order something else to use the entire $20 deal.  We choose the cheese garlic bread.  The food was great and the service was good. Could not have asked for more! Can't wait to go back. New York City pizza in Phoenix :)" "Great food and great service. Some staff may not be entirely welcoming Give em a try you will be guaranteed you will be back for more!!!!"  the place is clean. Price's are great!" Good pizza and wings at a good price. Can't really go wrong with Famous Rays Best NY pizza - consistently good. Always tastes better extra crispy or warmed up. 2 words .  Soooooo good! Love the pizza and the staff. The gravy could use some work. I'm a regular and it's the only place I'll get down home local (to me) pizza. When my boyfriend called to place an order for pickup he took too long and got hung up on I really like the NY-style pizza that Ray's gives ya. I dined in with the yelp $10 for $20 deal and got a Large Monster and it was delicious. The decor was extremely NY. The service was counter style which was down to earth. I will be going back for sure. Less one star because I've had better but this by no means isn't fantastic!  I got a great deal here. But the food took forever and the man behind the counter couldn't even crack a smile. No doubt it was good pizza though!" I LOVE their pizza! It is lightyears away from the chains and the family owned atmosphere is awesome. Also the slices are HUGE!  the cashier had such a genuine personality and was so friendly. The food...amazing. Best wings and pizza. :) The store had a comfortable atmosphere:)" "Worse ""Ray's"" I've been too! The girl told me that they raise their prices this time of year cuz of pizza. Took over 30 mins to get our food! Worst pizza ever!! It was just sauce and little but of cheese. Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $35 all of a sudden. Horrible food!!!" Just as good as it has always been - great pizza. I have also had their wings in the past and they're great too!"  you name it! You'll feel like you just stepped off the number 2 train and landed in NYC."  I enjoyed conversating with her. I purchased the $10 for $20 deal on YELP & tried getting the special large cheese pizza with 20 wings for $20.95 but the owner said it wasn't valid with my coupon  really dry wings. Never coming back... Btw the guy who answers the phone is not very friendly at all when asking for specials and sounded very annoyed when I called."  upstate type wings are fresh and served with blue cheese not ranch dressing.  Almost $50 for 2 pies with a couple toppings and 20 wings."  best pizza in town. Ill be the first to admit I'm a snob about pizza "We ate here 20 years ago and then moved away. Just came back for a visit and it's still delicious.  The service is very friendly and the pizza is amazing. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy.  The sliced sausage topping is my favorite. Pizza slice with sausage and pepperoni "Ray's Has Some Of The Best Pizza I Have Had In A While. Great Toppings "Great place to go for some really fantastic N.Y. pizza. We've been visiting this location for years and nothing from the friendly New York greeting to the taste of the pizza ever changes. If you get the chance "Love Ray's! My family has been ordering from here for years. They go out of their way to make you happy. I love the wings! Their white pizza is amazing. The wait everyone complains about is because everything is fresh just for you Great food!  Great pizza! Wings are best I've had in Phoenix by a long shot.   Smaller family like atmosphere with friendly service.  You can't go wrong with Ray's. Got some wings tonight. I ordered mild but they gave me hot! I called and complained and he wanted me to bring the wings back but I was already home and didn't want to go back out after a long day of work. So he offered me 12 free wings for the next time I wanted to order from them granted I ordered 20 and we only ate about 4 of them because they were hot. I would have given 4 stars had he offered the full order back but I guess 12 is fair. "Best lasagna I've ever had! And portions are huge! You can tell the family puts work into their food. Definitely New York style food and attitude (which I loved). This place is now my go to for Italian food. Even the loaf of bread was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm and soft inside! I'll be back Well I met with vinnie and he was awesome and very friendly and approachable I got the pizza and wings and able to eat the wings this time it was amazing. Best wings I have had in years they were juicy and crunchy and not small. I have been to some places where the wings are so small you get like one and a half bite of it but these wings are huge and the pizza that I was able to try for the first time was amazing as well. The cheese was flowing and piping hot and the sauce has to be a secret recipe past down from a family genius because it was perfect and not too over spiced or sweet. I am so glad he contacted me to try it out again and I know that our family Friday night pizza will be ordered from this place going forward in the future.  My kids even ate the crust and not sure about other people's kids but for mine to eat the crust it's nothing short of a miracle. Awesome food and great people and I will continue to be a repeat customer and I think that if you are reading reviews to figure which pizza place to try then look no further because this place is not expensive "I've been a customer of this location since 98. The food is amazing! The whole menu is really 2nd to none and you can always count on some sort of special.  It really feels like I'm back in NY when I step in this place. The service has always been a genuine kind of friendly and they're always quick Been going there for 15 years.  Great pizza!!  Real NY style pizza at a fair price.  there so nice there too. If ur getting dominos ur an idiot Been coming to rays pizza for about ten years never been disappointed. Pizza is always fresh and closet thing to a New York pizza "It was what I expected of a New York Pizza. Thin  didn't make you feel valued or important as a customer.  I don't need to feel all warm and fuzzy to get good food but sure am not going to give 5 stars when the guys filling our order are glaring at us like we just killed their puppy.  Maybe someone just got a backside-chewing.  Will give them another chance and hope for  decent service and still get good food."  it took me 10 minutes to find a spot and even then I just gave up and parked against a curb. Oh and the XL pizza is truly huge Fast service. Great pizza. Ordered an XL and it was very crispy on bottom...which is hard to do but they did it! Definitely would go back. The best Brooklyn Style Pizza in Phoenix. They even have Jamaica Beef Patties. You won't be disappointed. "Eating here right now. For $5 it's a steal here.  Really good. If I want pizza and I'm down here "Walked in here one night randomly spoke to the owner and he hooked me up on a pizza. It was really good  average rest of menu. Guys that answer the phone are a little rough around the edges but you expect that at an authentic pizza joint. I recommend this place over most." Great pizza use their yelp coupon it worked out great . Also had the meatball they were good too! I've been going to this pizza place for fifteen years. I use to live in the neighborhood and would visit weekly. I now visit every few months. Best sauce ever!  but come hungry.  The lasagna portion is large. My husband's meatball sandwich is really good and very large. We saw this restaurant in NY and wanted to try it but ran out of time. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix."  but our to go experience has always been great." 1.70 per topping is too much." Great deal for the money with the Yelp! deal for $10.  Pizza was good... NY style is not my favorite but I can recognize when something is good! "This pizza has been the Best Pizza I've ever had so far since moving to AZ last year!!! I ordered it extra thin and well done! When I took that first bite I literally had visions of my old pizzerias back in NYC! Right amount of crust I been going to this place ever since I moved out here from NY they know my family very well. I also have had the honor of eating at the rays in the city and honestly I can still remember them both tasting identical from the pizza to the Jamaican beef patties THIS IS THE REAL NY PIZZA!!!  although I'd still like to try some of the other things on their menu as they looked very enticing. I will stick to my local Chicago Style Pizza Joint for a nice thin crust square cut pizza! :-)" Best pizza ever and the staff is extremely nice I was so happy when I found this place right by my apartment! Best New York style pizza in the state. Food is real good reminds me of my home in Brooklyn "Everything is yummy ... especially the Monster Pie! They're not the friendliest guys in town A plus is they sell slices also and have small individual sizes as well." "I have been going to this Phoenix Ray's for 10 years since I moved to town from NY.  Great pizza and hot wings - reminds me of home!  Definately the most authentic in the valley.  There are too many other places that call themselves NY style I love their pizza whenever I am willing to spend a little extra and make the drive I certainly come here for their New York style pizza. The white pizza Is amazing!!! It's good but not as good as the Ray's located on Greenway. Which is some of the best Pizza in the Valley.  because as I said the pizza is delicious but probably not to dine in." Love it here! The staff is always friendly and accommodating. I like it that they remember their repeat customers and we are repeats because of the excellent food and service they provide. Thank you!  but the small order was definitely enough for 4 people. Comes with a side of delicious marinara also. Our pizza was pepperoni and mushroom and it was great  is just how Jersey these guys are. They're surly as hell Delicious pizza and wings. The pizza is New York style but not greasy or floppy. This is our families new go to place for pizza and wings. "Great place for a great slice! Always get 2 cheese pizzas and always come out right! Love this place "Love love love the white pizza!!! Super friendly staff Love this corner pizza joint!  Crust to cheese to sauce ratio is perfection.  Their wings are good too!  I often get their large pizza and 20 wing special for $22 bucks.  Service is good enough.  They are always busy.  but I would definitely go back! Wish the sauce was a little more garlicky (garlic slut over here haha!) but throw a little garlic salt on there with some crushed red pepper and you are good to go! Thanks Ray's for a great pizza!" Love this place. Been going here for years. Owners are surly but it feels more New York to me  but never again for their pizza or wings... Too many better options in the valley." As an east coast guy I know a good pie and this is a good pie The rest is of the food is good as well great little mom an pop joint with family ties to real east coast pizza has the feel of every mom an pop shop you miss from east coast  especially with toppings. Worth the price if you like good pizza." Pretty awful. Might work if you've never been to New York/ tasted pizza before. canned mushrooms got no place on a pizza in 2015 America (Review for by the slice ) Thin and soggy. Over priced 1 slice with three toppings ( they just add it to an already cooked slice and then reheat it) was $4. If I'm over paying for pizza I'd rather go to Johnnys at cave creek and Greenway. They have thin but not soggy pizza and they make the sausage and mozzarella fresh in house. Owner was nice. Pizza was good but not great. Fortunately had a yelp coupon which make it a great deal.  Good experience but not a do over. V3lQtk1LgwAEcF9j-BzchA Update: Recent full remodel bumps this pizza gem to 5 stars.  Famous Ray's is THE BEST. "I have been eating here since the 90s and I have to say famous Rays New York style pizza makes the best Chicago style pizza I had. We always order the Sicilian monster Highly recommended; I'm the guy in the wheelchair  the slice is no bigger than a slice from papa johns! Not at rays! My fianc and I are from New York and we were pleased to find this gem. The guys are pretty much straight from BK and are rather entertaining. Great spot! And food is affordable! And apparently you can enjoy a glass of wine for 3.50. Doesn't get much sweeter than that!" good place to have authentic new york style pizza! a bit pricy for everyday eating but worth to try. Amazing pizza and sandwiches!  I'm a regular here.  The people and food are both great! "I continue to be hooked on this joint!  In addition to all the items I've eaten that are posted in my review of 4/1/15; I've now tried the chicken parm "Food is always good but this is the third time in a row that the woman working the counter has been completely stone faced and looks like she hates her life.  Also Our first time here and it's really good! The Pizza was fresh and the wings were so good! Gonna come back again when I'm back in the valley. OlBs9lkLpswncPaE8w4-6w Great pizza and wings! Everyone that works there is really nice too! Highly recommend this place!  because the crust was excellent.  This Philly girl - new to North Phoenix - will be looking for someplace else for her next carry-out pie." There is some humor here also; each time they bring it to the table "Haven't had this in a long time. Every bit as good as I remember. Love it "Such a great place for pizza and wings! No matter what location you go to you will have the same high quality pizza. Great prices  a pizza joint that has good pizza and beef pepperoni! You can't go wrong with that combo." Great pie. Wonderful staff. Very relaxing and filling. Surely will be back and recommend it above any of the chains. "Great pizza folks. I've had a lot of pizzas in my time but this pizza ranks right up there with the very best I've had. They put generous amounts of toppings on there pizzas and the crust is by far more superior than most other pizza places out there. Don't just take my word on this folks I've been to this location at least 5 times and I plan to visit even more in the future. Don't confuse this Rays with others  the mushrooms are canned and I usually detest canned food but they season them beautifully. Very reasonable prices too." Solid New York Pizza here. Best in Phoenix hands down. best pizza place in phoenix.  we love to dine in.  it has the old school pizza place vibe. a very generous glass of wine is also a plus "For the record I been here maybe a total of 5 times and the pizza isn't very good but it's cheap for a slice. Due to it being so cheap I have Ended up getting sick of there pizza 3 out of 5 times I have no idea if it because it's under cooked or if it was bad ingredients. I just end up getting a vibe I shouldn't be there "We love this place. The servers aren't always the nicest Solid place for sure!" Always come here on our yearly vacation in Phoenix. This place is the great. The pizza is definitely authentic New York style. They also have good Yelp offers too.  they don't have fresh mushrooms in New York City!" "Been eating their pizza since I was a kid. Best pizza in Phoenix  the hot wing were REALLY hot...yummy! Great food yelp wants me to add more to make the review so here it is but again great food"  and dude looks at me like I am bothering him. With the secret two digit numerical code my wife relayed to me I was able to get my hands on the order. After acquiring the ordered items I shuffle slowly towards the register. Before 1 1/2 shuffles buddy behind the counter gave me some serious angry eyes asking if I paid! What!! I was obliged to promote their high traffic area and simply moved closer to the point of business where I could pay. Not cool. Insulting and honestly.... Never again. I hope they trained that staff to make sure they never get return business because in that scenario.... Job well done" This place does serve some pretty good pizza. The atmosphere though doesn't look all that great. I do like though is that they do have pictures around the place that do scream out America. Any kind of pizza that you order would be good.  fantastic wings and great service. I always order my wings with extra sauce so they reheat in the oven without becoming too dry. With the local chain I used to order from switching their ingredients to cheaper ones and changing over to fastrack ovens We love Famous Ray's. We have had the pizza and wings here and have never been disappointed. Plus I have a weakness for that NY accent. Nice guys!  every time. I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed. The most recent visit I got ""The Monster"" (peppers next time on this side of Phoenix will stop in again for sure."  great price and doesn't effect my wheat intolerance. I go out of my way to eat at Ray's! You should too" Moral of the story is: if you want legit NY style pizza  and very nice. Great calzone!! Thing was huge and delicious!! The pizza by the slice was average I will get the calzone again when I go back!!"  but not my style of pizza. I love a really thin crust and this is true NY style pie. If you like that kind of crust then I'm sure you'll love it. My husband thought it was amazing. They are very generous with the toppings." I really like this place. I'm from New Jersey and it's hard finding an authentic place around here. Great food and people Awesome spot! My kinda place. Very down-to-earth small hole in the wall. Food looks and smells great! "Great pizza and friendly staff!  I got the yelp deal of $10 for $20 and got a large thin stye pizza with 3 toppings for just a couple bucks out of pocket  this place takes me back to my NY childhood and the pizzeria that I used to work in. Very authentic all the way to the accent. Very good NY style pizza and great people that take care of you. We have only had the pizza and mozzarella sticks so far but plan to keep trying other menu items as we go back time and time again. Great find! Delicious!!!"    the Guy behind the counter has a great New York additude.  We got here just before there 130 mini rush  love the lunch special 2 slices and a drink. Some of the most easy going people I have talked to. No one can beat Ray's!"  sorry). I told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision (bc I'm indecisive) and I made my own creation. She saw that I had a Yelp coupon for checking in. She happily took it and I just paid the difference bc I the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink. She didn't have to accept my coupon but she did any way. While writing this my pizza came out and my order was called. I went up there and boy does it look good. I'm looking at it as I type. I'm taking my first bite!... I just ate half of it before continuing my review. It is delicious! I'm so lucky I found a pizza joint close to work and home. The prices are low especially for the quality. Definitely coming here again! Sorry  we didn't find it.  Just good pizza at a fair price.  I would bet the they make fresh dough daily!"  but most of it seemed like canned ingredients. It would be a definite buy if the pricing was more competitive. I might not try it again  a little crunch in the crust and the sauce and cheese cooked and melded together. The salad was pretty pedestrian. I'd like to try a few more items and would be willing to upgrade to a 5-star review after a larger sample" Delicious pizza and wings. Fed 4 hungry boys and all were happy. Owner from Brooklyn was fun to talk to and very accommodating.  and this place did . I tried a lot of pizzerias in Arizona but nothing can compare to this place I really like coming here.and I think this is the only pizzeria that carry Sicilian slice" As good as advertised.  Stopped in for lunch and I really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Got 2 slices and drink. Good pizza and a fun atmosphere. Eh. It's mediocre. Too greasy . But the wings were excellent.  Maybe I'll try it again.  haven't been here in years being that we moved over an hour away. Nothing has changed still great!!!"  there is ZERO NY style pizza/subs there.  Very good food!  F the Mets and Giants though  the Pizza was greasy; the white pizza with tomato and spinach was flavorless with sparse toppings. The wings were mediocre. Big slices  called back n there was a polite female who took our order n was told 20 min. Arrives n 14 n waited an additional  30 min. The cook appeared to be in a bad mood. Foods was good just don't believe the service worth it?" "This is the real deal. If you want real NY pizza Great tasting pizza! Excellent food. I highly recommend it. New York style pizza. The best pizza in this area by a long shot!  nothing crazy just needed a quick lunch and was happy to get too very hot slices. took my husband and son back on the weekend and saw some older women eating some pasta dishes there that looked really good I've sampled some good pizza on pizza tours in Chicago and used to live in New York and I would say this is not even close to good pizza."   leaving the other without and so expensive.  Not worth it." Server was really friendly and attentive."  quiet and comfortable pizza place that channels old New York with city decor. The seating consist of square tables and chairs-very simple and straight to the point. I must say that this location is hard to find because it is tucked away in the corner of the plaza. The menu had excellent choices for pasta  have a great appearance and the prices are right. Love the people working there."  I heart anything I can recycle!" Their passion bread (made from pizza crust) is super delicious but it really sucked that we couldn't dip in some marinara."  fun atmosphere and wonderful service. Each time we have eaten at this particular site we have had the same server. He is always calm   and i don't think i've had a bad pizza at this place. We get the lunch special sometimes or go there for a full pizza at dinner. I've never tried the sammiches or other pasta Great pizzas for very reasonable prices.  they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!" "Very few places can provide a delicious gluten free pizza and this place is one of them! Not only was the pizza good I will certainly be back." The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 starts is because it is a little pricey.  But I will be back"  ricotta and bacon and I have to say it was AMAZING!! So much so that my wife had 3 pieces! The kids enjoyed the spaghetti and pizza slice from the kids menu as well. Will visit again when in town next year for sure!!"  I will just stick with my original statement that the pizza is great and deserves a four star review based only on the quality/taste of the pizza." Came in to make an order to go and didn't have to wait too long. The girl at the counter was very nice and took my order right away. She offered water while we waited. The restaurant is kept very clean and they have 3 TV's showing sports. Great service and great food! I've been to other ones and the food is decent I went in here and it took them 15 min to even say hello after I sat at a table. I left and don't want to ever come back.  tasty and not very expensive. It was ready in less than 20 minutes and easy to pay/pick up. The establishment was clean and friendly. We typically dine organic  as in me and my family"" don't feel we need to try Streets of New York" rGHktXbee4CErLsMrPqbrA I'm a huge fan of their pizza pasta and omg the bread so good! Definitely great place to get some dinner or lunch!! I wish they delivered though!!  he made sure I received a new meal immediately. The girls there are friendly but always seem more interested in talking amongst themselves."  so slices are hard to hold. My family had to eat slices with a fork and knife. Service was nice and it wasn't busy for a Friday night Poor service waitress didn't know what it was when I asked for the complimentary pizza bread bites. They call it passion bread now and she still never brought it out once she figured it out. She didn't say the plate was extremely got and I almost dropped it all over me when I picked it up to move it. She didn't even ask if we needed anything and we are right across from the counter. It was as if she hated waiting on people and was in a bad mood. They have a pretty little patio with lights and really friendly staff around . We ordered for our custom made pasta and it tasted good ! Prices are slightly on the higher side .  not just iceberg lettuce like some other places. I will return just for this. Kids liked what they got. I liked the veggie marinara spaghetti I got. Not so keen on the pizza though. Service was slow  with only one server... And he was trying his best doing rounds and being as attentive as possible. Food was mediocre at best. Seemed like run of the mill ingredients and bread. The pizza crust was was good and fluffy with a bit of bite Amazing dinner salad!!  I know that sounds strange but really their dinner salad has every veggie you can imagine in it...not just lettuce and tomatoes like most...great value and great portion size.  I'm super excited to try the broasted chicken breast...I've heard of the concept but this is the first time I'm actually seeing it on a menu...fun to find out they deliver to my house...yes I can get broasted chicken delivered to my house!!  Jason is a great server too...really took the time to explain the broasted chicken. "My personal favorite restaurant in the area. This place is more like a family then just customer service "good food and nice environment but some of the staff is very mean and boring and act like they can't stand their jobs. my family and I were served by this younger girl one night (I don't remember her name) and she did not smile once at us This place is questionable at best. My order took over an hour for not even a mile away. My food was barely over room temp at best. And the manager Tony and his staff had an attitude with the fact that they messed up. Even to the point of raising their voice... We just had a great meal here.  Excellent had friendly service and great food.  A good place to go. Streets of New York pizza is awful.  Pizza is undercooked.  They are more worried about marking Broasted chicken than a decent pizza. They over charge and their ingredients are sub par. Save your money and don't bother to get food there. Go somewhere else for pizza. "I just start ordering carry out from here and I'm impressed with the friendly staff and I LOVE their spinach salad After getting my order I walked nearby to my workplace. Everything was awesome. From walking into the place- ordering- receiving order-enjoying- smiley face. All good"  I ate it and quickly realized it was  not a gluten free pizza. Thanks streets of new York for ruining  the rest of my night because I couldn't be more than 5 feet from a freaking toilet."  don't bother with the Margherita. All it consists of is soggy tomatoes and cheese. Basically no basil to speak of and no ""splash of balsamic"". How can you charge these prices for such a pitiful product?! Boo."  half New Yorker and half veggie.  It was average at best. You could tell our server wanted to be anywhere but working here  and salads in town.Service is always personal and fast. Have yet to order something here I don't love." The artichoke dip was decent as was the toscana." zwJX3eetOhpi-gv4-E4rcQ  the staff has always been friendly during my pickups. The previous review is correct in that they don't take anything over a $20; I think part of that is that they are not in the best area... I use a debit card so that doesn't matter to me at all. The new pastas they have here are very good so give them a try." Best pizza we had in a long time. Thanks. I don't think anybody beats Pizza Hut and the way they did the pizzas This place has crappy customer service. They forgot part of our order from tonight. When we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful. I guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order  how do I know this well her hands were full of white cheese (the older lady very nice but not so clean) and when I got my Debit card back it stuck like cheese!!  Gross I will not be going there again.  I hope she washes her hands before making the Pizza.  This is the Pizza Hut on 7th st and union hills." I live nearby and probably order from here at least two or three times a month. I usually pick up my order and order online. I have never had a negative experience and have actually had great customer service every time. Maybe they have made some changes as I see others have not had as much luck. Either that or we reap what we sew I suppose... Just do yourself a favor and DO NOT expect any customer service from this location. Go elsewhere. I will be driving to a different Pizza Hut just to avoid this kind of awful handling of issues that arise. I know things happen but the way you deal with them is how you retain customers. Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I asked Adam I ordered a complicated order and its late on a Friday. Order was delivered quickly and accurate and it was really great. First time ordering from here and I gotta say best pizza I've had from a Pizza Hut ever. Thanks guys!  which we did not order and the toppings were scarce. We had 1 medium pizza to share with 5 people. Threw them both in the trash! What a waste amd I personally ate a apple for dinner. Manager tried Ill give him that  they've always been willing to make it up to me. This location was clearly not interested in making things right and is hugely disappointing. And because of that mistake I will no longer order from this location. I am happy to go to another pizza establishment that caters to customers and quite frankly has better pizza. Pizza Hut "I ordered delivery and as soon as it came and I grabbed a slice of pizza I noticed an inch of dark hair in my pizza. I don't have dark hair. And when I called I read all these bad reviews on Yelp and Google and almost thought twice about ordering just now. But we've always had good pizza and no problems with service. The guy on the phone was nice and even took our order and found a way to get us a cheaper deal.  too much sauce.  Pizza was not nearly as warm as I would have though and the cheese sill had un melted pockets in the pie.  What happened to you Za Hut?  Obviously this location has issues to deal with."  the food has arrived lukewarm.  It pretty clearly was made too far in advance then just sits somewhere.  My pizza was basically room temperature and the fries I ordered were limp and soggy."  he calls and asks me to come to his car because its raining outside! Are you kidding me!  Wings box was smashed and food was room temperature at best. This place is crap and deserve to keep the minimum wage they should be earning." I have been ordering here for a about 2 years now. And every single time I order they make it perfectly and on time. Pizza and Wings both! Keep it up! :) Thank you! :) I hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west." I have since found that this location delivers to my place (dangerous discovery) and have fought hard to limit my indulgences. But if you like pizza with a thin I give Spinato's four stars due to the deliciousness of the pizza and the fact that I'll likely make return visits.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers too!" pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw  but their spinach pizza (award winning) has to be the best around.  It would have to take a lot to dethrone this place as my favorite pizza joint.  Their cheesy garlic bread is also pretty good." Greatest pizza in the valley. Only thing that compares is oregonoes. Hands down the Best Pizza in town!  Best Sausage...Mmmm!  mind you..  My very happy ASU friends ordered up a Chicago style pizza from Spinatos.. THIS pizza rocks the valley; enuf said. It has a perfect crust texture.. and just the right amount of toppings & every week since then  but sometimes I get carried away and eat way too much of it! Last night we picked up a ""Super 6"" and ate the whole thing in about 20 minutes it was so good! Their pizza is the absolute best I have ever had. From the scrumptious crust and savory sauce to the tasty toppings that are baked into the incredible cheese I don't know another pizza that makes me so happy!"  but this thing was incredible! We got a medium and split it and wished there was more after it was gone. Well done!" "They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach pizza = the best ever! **** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with  Oh my... so good..Ordered the same as last time expect on our pizza our waitress recommended to put onions on it...she was right that was gooooooood.  Hubby and me fought over the leftovers that night...hehe...   so good.."  Spinato's has a really sweet sauce on their pies that I cant get enough of. Square cut pizza is always easier to share with the family too. Eat-in or takeout service is always top-notch."  but we only waited for a minute before being seated. the service was fast. The staff was polite. The pizza was very good. I wouldnt say that it was the best that I ever had.... because Deluca's Pizza in Lansing  hit Spinato's.  http://www.spinatospizza.com/"  I'm treated like family.  Excellent service and excellent food at a great price.  My favorite is the Mama's Spinatos Signature Fresh Calzone with Ricotta.  It is out of this world good!" This place is awesome! My favorite is the Garlic Spinach pizza.  I'd recommend Spinato's. We will definitely be going back (mainly so my husband can try the spaghetti calzone)" $30 for a Margherita pizza and some Bruschetta it was ok nothing really memorable about it though other than the price. After reading some of the other reviews I will give it another chance and try something else though.  but for the fact they can no longer get Spinato's pizza.  Count yourselves incredibly fortunate to be living in The Age of Spinato's."  fast and friendly waiters and waitresses (can you still say that or are they really just waitpeople now?) The food is great -- all of their offerings. The atmosphere is homey Service is excellent they knew immediately what we ordered last time. We tried the signature pizza this time since its the most popular. The delivery was very quick I admit but the pizza still leaves me looking for a new pizza place. The toppings were all good spinach nice and crispy and then the sauce is good but way too sweet for my taste! It makes me wonder if the secret seasonings have something to do with sugar? Oh well I really tried liking this since its so close but what can a girl do?" One of my students moms raved about this place so we tried it. Now their pizza is my favorite! It's sweet and a delightful change from the corporate pizza out there.  but it's something about the combination of ingredients and the authentic pizza parlor feel when you bite into a slice. It's just one of those pizzas you have to try in your life. So Ken stopped by our table and had a nice conversation with him about Yelp and how we found his restaurant and how I would go home and yelp about Spinato's." This is THE PLACE to take anyone that you wish to impress with an excellent meal."  too.  My vegetarian friend appreciated the veggie options here.  I will put this out there though... their breaksticks must be sprinkled with love (or crack) because when they're on the table My favorite pizza in town. Its all about their pizza sauce in my opinion. Once you eat at Spinato's you become like family. MMM GOOD!"  the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly  The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs P.S. I loved their family photo on the pizza box!" Unique pizza that's great to mix up the usual slice routine once in a while."  delivery was on time and courteous and the price was very reasonable.  I'll want to try the restaurant now-- absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had here and definitely beat any other delivery.  Home run!" I love taking out of town friends & family here because it is local owned & operated. A great family place and reasonably priced!"  one of the best pizzas in town.  I've been eating here since the mid 90's and it has consistently been great!  I usually get the Super Six.  It has everything on there except the kitchen sink!   The thin crust is never ever soggy and that sweet sauce is like crack to me!  The service is always great.  Do expect a wait on Fridays and Saturdays.  If you have more than 8 people in your party The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait." The spaghetti and meatball calzone was genius. Would have likes more sauce in the calzone but maybe I didn't order  it properly. The thin crust pizza was very good reminded me of Donato's back in Indy. Would definitely go again this was a pick up order will try in restaurant next time. . pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw All I can say is this place is absolutely amazing. One of the best pizzas or the best pizza I've ever tasted. I ate til I was miserable.. Delicious pizza and worth every penny!"  Spinato's didn't disappoint! We had the spinach/garlic/tomato (their house special) and it was delicious. Different for sure than a typical NYC pizza The only knock on this location is the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired. We'll be back :)" Definitely a new fave pizza spot for me."  N. Scottsdale and North and Central Phoenix you have NO EXUSE not to go. My only complaint about Spinato's is I eat way If you like your sauce sweet - I mean SUGAR sweet then this is the place for you. It does remind me of some Chicago pizzas I had as a kid - Just don't care much for the suagr sauce anymore...to each their own...  but I feel it was worth the wait.  I wanted to try this place because it says its the best pizza in arizona.  Two pizzas I enjoyed the most were Combo and Mama Spinato's pizza.  Right in the middle between soft and crunchy The best pizza in the great state of Arizona! Enough said A NJ girl has a hard time finding great pizza in AZ.  This place is Chicago style but not deep dish like pizzeria UNO.  The sauce is sweet just like i make at home.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful without being to much.  The bruschetta is fantastic!  No reservations so be prepared to wait but it is worth it!  The take and bake option provides a great product without all the standing around.  feta and salami... and it is literally the best pizza we've ever had! Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good  but a little pricey - its expensive when you add $5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza"  best pizza crust ever!!! It was so delish! Look forward to another trip back and work my way through the menu!" "Spinatos has the best pizza in Phoenix by far! The sauce is delicious and the mamas signature spinach pizza is amazing! I can't resist the canoli for dessert  the sodas come with that really awesome crushed ice that looks like jagged little pellets. To me  maybe we should make it a 2 times per week minimum stop." Perfect what can I say yummy .good service  and the best sauce I was not impressed at all by the entire meal."  we had the Chicago pizza...fantastic!!! I can't wait to come back here again and try their other pizzas and calzones. So happy I was introduced to the greatness that is Spinato's!!"  good taste and good cheese also. At least the specialty is not spicy." I'm happy to say that Spinato's lived up to the hype." pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw I would recommend Spinatos Pizza to EVERYONE and I can't wait to go back! :)"  very good pizza. I'll be back."  but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle!"  but it works. I'm looking forward to trying the location in Scottsdale. I'm thinking about trying  a calzone."  you should definitely try it.  They also have the best gluten free crust!  I order it even though I don't have any problem with gluten.  Their family recipe sauce is sweeter than most but still very good.  If you're looking for a local pizza place you can't find anywhere else Love love their spaghetti calzones...the sauce is not too tangy and they add just enough cheese and the dough/ crust is baked just right. Incredible pizza!  Garlic bread was good too!  A little pricey but totally worth it. We definitely go back and try something different.  We visited for lunch on 12/31/11 - not too busy  - yet......." i would easily blow my paycheck here IF they had wings too...but the pizza is good enough for half my paycheck..."  the signature mama is so yummy!  I love that they deliver to my home too!" "Yum. Signature Mama all the way. This is a great place (I haven't had any calzone or pasta dishes  italian beef and basil. Toppings are ALWAYS plentiful. If you think the sauce is too sweet (which I don't) try adding garlic  but everyone seemed happy.  We were there for lunch during work and the service was great.  Never a dirty plate or an empty glass.  Would def recommend this place again." "I'm glad that I finally found yet another pizzeria that offers gluten-free options for pizza and other items. The gluten-free pizza crust is made by GFC (Gluten Free Creations Awesome chicago style pizza. Finally a great pizza place in Arizona. AWESOME PLACE THOUGH! check it out."  tastes like home. I've found my go to pizza place! Please go and judge for yourself!"  it has to be good. Spinato's lives up to its reputation for having really good pies. I tried a large mushroom and antipasti salad. Both were very good and I would recommend this for someone looking for an oldie but goodie for pizza. It looses a star bc there is one or two other places that may be better..."  I was involved in a car accident on my way to pick it up.  When I called to let them know I couldn't make it they were more concerned for my personal safety then a pizza that didn't get picked up.  About 30 minutes later Best gluten free pizza ever!! "Absolutely phenomenal pizza. This place has been right down the street from my home for years and I finally got around to trying it. I can't believe I waited so long. Spinato's pizza is very very good. I got delivery so I couldn't say anything about the dinning experience but their product is fantastic. After just one pizza (the Chicago)  that's how I was introduced. We used to always get the Hawaiian pizza until we discovered the spaghetti calzone. If you're a fan of carbs and the idea of a pasta-filled calzone sounds appealing Great place!  Lunch prices are good. Service was fantastic. Pizza is great.  pizza and cheese ravioli and all of it was excellent.  We also tried the apple/cinnamon dessert which also was outstanding.  We highly recommend it!"  the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered Ive only eaten here once but it was amazing!! The service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious. I will find my way back here for sure.  good food.  Ask for Jimmy...he's a kick." I would definitely caution everyone ordering a delivery from Spinato's Pizza you just might not get a pizza."  which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always Spinatos has a sweet sauce unlike anything I've ever tasted it definitely makes the pizza.  It's amazing." My only complaint was that it was abnormally loud in the small place. Almost to the point we could not hear each other at times. Have plans to return soon. They do not serve any fried foods  don't waste your time going elsewhere. I especially enjoy sausage Great pizza we love to order takeout! Visiting from Ca. We found Spinato's. The pizza was delicious the beer was cold and the service was great. A great atomsphere. The pizza here is delicious! Not as greasy like other places. The cheesy bread sticks with marinara sauce is so amazing. This is one of my favorite places to have pizza. Service is great. Very good pizza they put a nice family touch on there pies. The red sauce is a little to sweet but good. They have a awesome spinach style pizza which is great and a Italian beef calzone is worth a try "The Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is the most amazing pizza I have ever had.  I don't even put it in the same catagory as regular pizza.  We can order peperoni pizza or what ever from any place.  But the Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is speacial Best veggie thin crust of all time! This place is the best in phoenix and I am obsessed! Great service and just straight up tasty.  I bought a jar of sauce to take home so we'll see if its as good as the fresh."  calzones...   well really just about anything on the menu is fabulous. Their homemade sauce is to die for and unique to itself.  I have dined in and the ambiance is great.  Taken out This place is starting to become my favorite pizza place that isn't delivery. Really good."  bad management and service. Get take out!"  calzones are outstanding and the staff make you feel like family. Spinato's is our go-to pizza joint and we have never been disappointed. Definitely want to get there early to avoid the rush." It's amazing! The spaghetti is the best I have had and the pizza is bomb too. This is a great spot for date night or take out.  it's a good pizza.  I did like the Mamma Spinato's signature fresh spinach.  We also had the traditional vegetarian What seals the deal with the 5 stars is the service. I have NEVER had a bad experience. The staff is wonderful whether you dine-in or takeout. We were eating there just this weekend and I was amazed at how well they work together. If someone sees your drink empty  and a cool small Italian family owned restaurant feel. The garlic cheesy bread appetizer is great too  the service is good and best of all Best pizza in the valley!  Love to bake at home too!  Great service. The staff was nice and very attentive to our party of 10. Nothing to complain about at all from our visit. Great job." "Love this place! A real taste of Chicago. Awesome pizza and calzones! Servers are weird but who cares when I get such oh delicious italian food  but way above average and well worth the extra trip."  this is not good pizza. . ." HXw6sZuWKH6OiBrLnuyblw pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw sHi82eZ6Dl62lSZ9ZaWcTg The waitress was very nice." FIUAZvRvVkeoBcLwwVte4w "If you want a great family restaurant when you visit Phoenix offering superior pizza and salad "Found this place by accident when someone brought in some pizza for lunch. Wow just had to go check it out for myself.  Walked into the take out section placed an order and they gave me a free fountain drink while I waited.  Very clean "Been here twice. Never dissapointed. Really good pizzas  but that is to be expected on a Friday night. service was friendly and prompt and the server even gave out preggo friend a t-shirt for her baby which was incredibly unexpected. Two appetizers and a pizza were enough to satisfy the appetite of four people. The food was great like we anticipated so there were no surprises there. On top of all that they had a selection of a few Arizona wines which we definitely took advantage of. In short Spinato's scored high for me in all areas." Also - take home any leftovers - they re-heat great for a couple days!" We will definitely be back ASAP!!" "Extremely average pizza. The server was very nice and helpful This is the best pizza we've found since migrating from Chicago 17 years ago! The staff is amazing - Quality is consistent and prices are fairly reasonable!  The Bell Road Location has the best service and is so convenient - as we live in New River - close to NOTHING! LOL  Truly recommend this place for Chicago transplants!  - THIS is what good food is all about!!! I'd rather have had DiGiorno!......and I hate DiGiorno.  After reading the reviews I figured there was no way we wouldn't like it and the bad reviews were the usual complainers.  Let be clear in saying I rarely write a bad review but this one warranted one.  We both ordered the personal pan pizza and it was barely enough for my appetite but I didn't want to spend over 10 dollars on a pizza for myself.  The sauce was horrible!  It was sweet and my taste buds were confused.  The server admitted that its a particular taste and the taste was not for her lol.  Go figure that the employees don't even like the pizza.  I never had a pizza with a sauce that was that sweet.  It was very strange.  The people who rated this 5 stars must have no taste in food.....sorry.  My fiance at one tiny slice and walked out hungry.  I finished mine and thought to myself..what the heck am I eating.  The one thing I can say is that they comped her meal at least.  We didn't ask but they did.  but crust and cheese make it an incredible combination.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  This is a must have!" The waiter was wonderful. The food was wonderful. And the environment was great. Would def go back and recommend to others!" Do yourself a favor - avoid and have a real pie.  No need risking Type II Diabetes from dinner." Great pizza and service here.  They are a key player on our take out rotation.  We like do do a half Lil' Italiana and a Half Get Meaty but sub the Canadian bacon with meatballs.  Omnom pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw OMGthis pizza is the bomb that's all i gotta say! And go on Thursdays.  Trust me.  Half price pitchers.  Enough said." I absolutely love this place. I just moved back to Arizona from New Mexico and was really excited to find a local pizza place. There is a perfect amount of garlic in their pizzas. Its just fantastic. I've never gotten a bad pizza ever.. "Great pizza! Their sausage and mushroom and the spinach and tomato were amazing! I don't know how they make their sauce it's different but definitely very tasty  thin crust.  Amazing sauce like no other.  Delivery takes a bit but it is well worth the wait!"  and they have a small and quaint ambience.  The service is great while the pizza just tastes amazing.  We will definitely be back for my pizza cravings after church!" "Ordered delivery and it smelt amazing as soon as it arrived at the front door and tasted even better...  Very  they have Pepsi products!!!! Hooray! I got the Italian sub sandwich and the hubs for a little personal pizza We are definitely sold on this hot spot for pizza!" The pizza is delicious!!!! I had half Hawaiian half spicy Italian on thin crust & it was so good!! The cheese to sauce to toppings to bread ratio was perfect. It's going to be my new go to pizza place. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. Now that I've finally read other reviews on this place...it looks like I'm going to have to be stopping in!"  but expect delivery on weekend evenings to take 60-75 minutes.  Great flippin' pizza though."  so you end up with edge pieces that have a nice crisp crust on them and then you have this whole section of soggy middle pieces with no crust at all. We ended up eating around the outside and I guess the middle will go into the trash.  All in all we are putting this on the ""never again"" list. We can get a delicious pizza from Aiello's that is nearly twice the size for the same cost and it will usually arrive on time.  I will say the person who answered the phone and the guy who delivered the pizza were both very nice."  the food is not my cup of tea. I ordered a side caesar to begin and a pepperoni calzone. The caesar dressing was very fishy. The pizza sauce was way too sweet." "Worth every penny and then some. The secret is in the sauce I am pretty sure. The pizza is thin crust and sliced into squares so each piece is easy to handle. Meats are great and fresh I had a hungry family of 12 visiting from out of town and decided to try this place based on their Yep (Yelp Rep). They delivered big time. The pizzas arrived at my door on time and hot. We ordered 'da greek' and it got rave reviews from everybody. I will definitely order from them again!  recent functional expansion to get carry-out orders out of the way of dine-in guests. Bartender (i think Vicki) is fantastic If you enjoy and are open to different types of pizza The place is a bit small and there can be a wait during peak hours but that's true for any good place in town. Molly was our wait person (not sure if she's still there) and she's friendly and provided great service."  the location was convenient for the time that we had to give. On this trip we tried a Sicilian pepperoni pizza (excessively oily) and a MaMa's signature calzone (wet and runny The customer services had a little New york attitude (rude and fast) but its okay it was all worth it." "Shout out to the guy on Trip Advisor who said the L'Italiana here is the best pizza in Northern Phoenix...I don't live locally Pizza is good! sauce is sweet. They have lots of options.  even if it is a little crowded." I would also suggest the spaghetti and meatball calzone and almost any sandwich. You really cannot go wrong at Spinatos." If you are looking for pizza on the sweeter side with friendly servers this place stays consistent in its tastyness!  we started with a caesar salad and the meatball trio. The salad was pretty typical but still worth it. Skip the meatballs; the sauce on them was exactly the same texture and taste as everyone's favorite eponymous canned pasta product we all grew up with.  Great when you are eight  and then it got thrown away.  Such a waste.  The pizza was tasty. I would suggest to the owner to have some flexibility on common sense policy.  The manager suggested the possible reason for the policy is the kitchen chef is too busy to deal with these requests.  I would suggest that it only takes a split second to see the order ""no ham"" and would not slow the process down.  Not to mention then food would not be wasted.  I feel sorry for the employees who have to enforce and explain this excessive policy  and vegetables and meat are spread generously. My take out order was on time and Kimberly greeted me with a smile. I was told by the owner months before that the pizza sauce recipe has been passed down for generations. We'll Done!" I never have had a bad experience here.  Best GF crust ever!!! Service was extremely friendly on the phone and during pickup.  Bonus points for having fantastic napkins!  They are basically 22 squares of thick paper towel like napkins.  Possibly the best napkins I have ever been issued for a takeout spot lol.  I will be back to try out some other pizzas in the near future...probably dine in to see if the crust is crisper.  Overall  an older gentleman came walking around asking tables how everything was.  It turns out that it was the OG himself...Ken Spinato!   The guy who started this place back in the 70s.  We chatted for awhile and got into a good conversation about our move from San Diego and how we were going to go to Grimaldis but came here instead.  He was impressed that we had driven from Surprise to come here.  We had a great conversation about pizza "Sone of the best pizza in Arizona.  I'm from NY so I can't say best ever. .. Haha   sweet yummy pizza! And the pizza didn't take long to make at all! If you like a sweeter sauce "Simply whoa. This place is my new Italian restaurant. Everything tastes top notch and worth every penny! The pizza was one of the greatest ive ever had. And I LOVE pizza. My wife got the pasta "I went here for the first time on Sunday. I got the gluten free pizza and it was absolutely the best GF crust I've tasted. They get it from the Gluten Free Creations Bakery which is local. It is seasoned with rosemary and so delicious! Prices were reasonable My favorite sauce of Pizza in the Valley. It's a little pricey but definitely a great Pizzza.  but not crispy or tasty at all. The sauce is overly sweet. The cheese tastes like government surplus cheese used in school cafeterias. The pepperoni is bland and tasteless. Overall very average Only pizza I will eat! Sauce is amazing and they are not skimpy on the toppings at all! Happy Hour has some great deals as well! Service is always great I highly recommend going out to eat there! The pizza is really good with wine. Best pizza in the valley. Get there early if you want a seat this place fills up fast.  and tomato bits strewn about in some tinfoil. (maybe the mozzarella sticks will be great) Cold. Just like the Super 6 i ordered. Sad day in pizza eating history. I am not sure if regular management was away.. Or they had new management? But i was incredibly disappointed in the feedback i received when i called to complain that i just spent $70 on some Cold "Love this place. The sauce has a sweet taste and a little different from the norm. They have pretty good salads but let's face it. You come here for the carbs. Love their pizza and also the spaghetti with homemade meatballs. Such great service consistently. My husband and I love to come here and definitely do at least once a week. Also The service was awesome. He didn't over bug and was very nice. It was a nice quiet evening filled with mouth watering pizza and beer. Can't ask for a better sunday night (oh and football was on the tv in the bar)......"  and the pizza is awesome here too. It's quickly becoming my favorite date night location with my wife." Always great friendly service when dining in or taking out. They specialize in thin crust pizzas and The Get Meaty is my favorite. The menu is extensive and you can do half and half specialty pies to keep things interesting. I really enjoy the family owned vibe. Highly recommend and I would eat here again!  ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time  mellow atmosphere. We had the pear and Pecan salad which was fresh and delicious. The pizza was great--fresh ingredients and arrived hot. Friendly staff."  it's worth it. There pizza IS 100% best in Pheniox!"  but every dish I have had bursts with flavor. If you get a chance to go make sure to save room for dessert because holy cannoli!" First time ordering pizza and salads. All I can say is 'excellent'. You are really missing out if you don't try their pizza.  Love it. The spicy Italian pizza has changed my life. I can't even try anything else here and all other pizza is just ordinary. Unfortunately they are closed on Mondays but the pizza rocks. Yummy...change in review...they are now open on Monday. Yay!!!  and too expensive for the chance to be so badly disappointed again.  I would have given less stars if not for the first experience.  I at least know that they have the potential for excellence This place is always busy and always friendly. The pizza is awesome!! Thanks for being great! Anytime I venture out & try a different pizza place I wind up disappointed & compare it (unfavorably) to Spinatos. Well "Yum yum yum!  Who doesn't love a spaghetti calzone? Carb overload that will put you in a delightful carb coma!  The service is a little hit or miss  her customers. As we  enjoyed our meal several other patrons were seated and Maria wound up with table after table of regulars. Seriously felt like we could end up part of the Spinatos Family!" Mmmmm. Pizza just like I remember back home in Illinois!!! Love it! Best ive had in AZ! All in all I would say if you enjoy good thin crust pizza this spot will not let you down!"  but a bit pricier than expected. Dinning area cramped." Awesome pizza and service. They brought it right to our hotel and we're super friendly.  Loved the garlic bread too! "Two words. Spaghetti. Calzone. You'll thank me later! Opt for meatballs and ricotta! The pizza/spaghetti sauce is slightly sweet. Love it.  We also get the specialty spinach pizza-lots of garlic "Great food. Reasonable prices. Maria was an awesome server. I highly recommend you make reservations Their pizza is great! Their sauce has a sweetness to it that most don't.  The staff is really friendly and the place is pretty quaint. My husbamd loves the Mamma' Calzone and their Get Meaty pizza is my favorite.  All in all its a great spot to try!! If you have a chance you definately need to try this place!! Ravioli with vodka sauce is the best!! Service is great they are always extremely friendly and food comes out fast!! Don't pass this place by. The Super-Six Pizza can't be beat. I've not tried the other dishes because the pizza is so good." "Our Da Greek pizza was among the best pizza I've had. We dined outside at lunch time on a recent Tuesday.  We had the outdoor patio to ourselves Spinato's is a a decent sized restaurant. The food is very good. The staff there is super friendly. The waitress I had was very open and comfortable in making a conversation with you. On our way cross town. Yelp says Spinattis is great. We stopped for pizza and Yelp was right. Enjoyed the cool patio even tho temp is over 90. Also our service was fantastic. We prefer thin crust. This was perfect thin crust. Not wimpy and limp like some. Good there are other ones in the valley too. Coming back for sure.  tasteless crust and an oversweet sauce; maybe it had something to do with the fact that the pizza was stuck in their version of a heat lamp Everytime i have had take out.  Pizza is always good. Its well worth the extra money for a decent pie. Heard all the talk about the great food and it was average. Pizza was ok and spagetti was bland with sweet sauce.  I'll try again but not right away. "Been here a few times. The service is always great  and I have never had a bad meal!  The food is great and so is the staff.  Try the spaghetti calzone  and wow! It was delicious and the only pizza place I get sauce added on. The crust is cooked perfectly. My favorite item would have to be the spaghetti calzone- I get it with the vodka sauce & the meatballs added in. So delicious and always a good way to end a long day! It's my go to pizza joint." "THE BEST PIZZA! First timer and was blown away. Get the ""Get Meaty"" pizza. Superb!!! Great service Why 4 stars not 5 - nothing to do with the food - i do wish they would deliver to my house :/ they will deliver to business by me but not my house. Second- they took away Diet Dr.pepper - not cool. WE ALL WANT IT BACK. :)" As a tip join the email list to receive coupons for your birthday and holidays."  ordered appetizer and salad and they came out fairly quickly. Strawberry Gorgonzola salad was good size and tasted good!  Spinach artichoke was just warm but tasted good.  We waited another 20 minutes for another personal pizza to come out. Again just warm. In this time we chomped on ice as our drinks were empty. Our calzone came out after our daughter was completely done with her pizza. While bringing our calzone Finally had the time to try Spinatos for our 41st anniversary. Victoria was our waitress and she was great. Started off with a capese appetizers and it was very refreshing. Moved onto six meat pizza/meaty pizza and Chicago steak calzone. Every dish was delicious and portions were substantial. Party of three ate for less than 60.00 dollars with drinks (sodas and beer). Enjoyed dinner so much that we are planning a revisit. Love This Place!  The staff is super friendly and the pizza is awesome  ...just wear your loose pants because they're gonna stuff you! "This place is great.  I have always just gotten to-go but they are almost always packed inside so i assume the service is great too.  Everyone that caters to the pick-up side has always been wonderful.  Calzones are really good Everything is made fresh at Spinato's. They have some of the tastiest freshhome made sauces. Be sure to check out the website. You can order food to go."  Sicilian....we could go on forever. Spinato's Pizza is perfect for my taste. Almost as good as Ledo's on the University of Maryland campus. First the crust was thin and perfect. (There are other crust options...but I ordered thin.) The sauces was sweet. The cheese had just the right amount of greasiness and the toppings were plentiful. This is NOT crispy crust brick oven pizza...this is great loaded with toppings pizza. I have now found my favorite pizza place in Phoenix (sorry Oregeno's!) and I will be back." We will be back - thank you so much Spinatos."  I would think twice about Spinato's given they way they handled their error." We found Spinatos the day we moved to the 16 St. And Bell  area. Amazing pizza! I was hooked the first time we ordered. We will definitely be back again!!!" "I tried the Toasted Da Vinci sandwich yesterday and it was outstanding. One of the best sub sandwiches in town. Toasted bun  the staff is very friendly.   Customer service is great.   Canoli was very good.  Reason for the 2 star is the sauce it is very sugary.   In my opinion sauce should not taste like this.   I cant eat anything here that has sauce.   The pizza is very overated Everyone loves pizza and this place does it right! My favourite dishes to recommend are the spaghetti calzone and the bruschetta. which I can tell the difference in the pizza in the dine in area is alway amazing !!!! Take out from here is just so so. I really think the Glendale location is best now they are always 100% consistent in flavor of their special sweet sauce oh that is the best part after all of this place :) I have not tried their dessert in all the years I have been one here but they look really good . If you are looking for something tasty and different than a normal pizza this is the place to try." I go to Spinato's at least once a week. Usually get it to go. However on a Saturday afternoon we went by and ate. We had their pizza special . We were able to get 2 of the small specialty pizzas for $8 each. That means the Super Six for my boyfriend and I. His 10 year old got the all meat pizza. It s a very good deal and value. The wait staff is attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The place for a Saturday afternoon was quite busy but it still had a relaxed feel. Our pizza was delicious and we managed to have enough to take home from both of the pizzas. Spinatos is the best pizza in my book. Hands down the best delivery we have found in this area. Sometimes it takes closer to an hour and a half to deliver. That tells you how awesome they are. Never had a bad pie from these guys!  they have their menu down to a science. Another plus is that they have a take & bake option. As well as a jar of sauce for purchase to take home.   They have outside seating for when great weather emerges. Waiting area is a bit cramped but I suppose that is why the bar is right there.  They hire great staff - friendly and attentive. Highly recommended Spinato's." Their pizza is always so good! For some reason I can't get enough of the Greek salad. Thanks for a great dinner tonight! "Some people like dessert with their meal. The marinara and pizza sauces (if they're not the same) at Spinatos have enough sugar in them to give you cavities after one meal. The environment was appealing but loud We go weekly on Friday or Saturdays to see Maria and eat meatballs. They are the best but how Maria takes care of us is so personal. We love her! Great food and great service!  Every pizza and pasta we have had is amazing.   The sweet sauce on the pizza is like nothing we have ever had.  Maria is one of the best waitress.  Spinatos is definitely a must try! "After we moved to Phoenix we searched for restaurants that had birthday deals. Spinato's sent us a birthday coupon so we figured we've give it a try. My husband and I fell in love with the pizza "This was the best pizza I've had since moving to the north valley in the last year and a half. I have finally found my pizza place. I've tried them all This place is great! Great service every time. They have an awesome spaghetti calzone we all like. Our new Friday night family dinner go to. Guessing our son will be a regular. Not sure if that's a blessing or a curse!"  soooo crispy (even Sicilian style!) the toppings had tons of flavor and color. It was the best pizza I've had in years! I did not find that to be so at the 7th St. Location. And as usual...  Excited to come back sit on their patio when it cools down. It looks so cute! Interior is very cute as well I had heard rave reviews about the pizza and having grown up in Brooklyn I was practically raised on pizza. I was very disappointed in the pie we had. We purchased the par cooked and finish at home pizza. We followed the instructions and found the pizza to not be up to what we had been expecting. The crust was not firm at all and the pizza had a overly strong oregano smell. I like oregano but this was overpowering. We might try it again but won't be rushing back any time soon. "It is all about the sauce! I had the Mamma Spinato's pizza and added Italian sausage and it was really good. The sausage gave me texture but not so much flavor I LOVE Spinatos. The pizzas are delicious and they have peroni on tap. There aren't many better ways to spend a hot Sunday afternoon in Phoenix. Highly recommend. This pizza was ordered at my job. Their pizzas are on point. The fennel thin crust pizza was the best pizza I ever have eaten.  and the staff was friendly.  The pizza was ready when they said it would be." We were greeted by the friendly hostesses and seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and he answered questions we had about entrees and pizzas on the menu. He was very knowledgeable. We were served our ice teas and soda's right away. Our order was placed and our food came out fresh and hot. My daughter and I had the gluten free garlic bread for an appetizer Delicious calzones! They are filling and tasty. It's my go to item on the menu. My husband loves the thin crust pepperoni pizza. Drinks are a little pricy but then they give you a gigantic cup so it's worth it! pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw We were upset that the price of the meatballs went up $2 on happy hour. The savings is $.95 from regular menu......not much of a happy hour savings."  and a simple menu. We ordered the cheese and artichoke crostini for an appetizer. It was basically cheesy artichoke dip on ciabatta bread. It came with 4 pieces and was easy to eat and saved us from using too little or too much dip ourselves. For pizza we ordered the small (11 in) chicken presto pesto and it was delicious! Chicken I love the food here. The cheese ravioli is so incredibly creamy and the vodka sauce is on point. Pizza is always delicious and the staff is friendly. 1/2 price wine Wednesdays.  Life is good!  Food here is AMAZING!  By far best pizza in town! "My husband and I love Spinato's! This is the original location and they have the best service. We we always share the spaghetti calzone with meatballs. Their salads are delicious and they have gluten free pizza for the people with medical conditions. The place is affordable and original. Love the vibe at this location. We had our rehearsal dinner at the new location on 7th Street - much larger and less traditional The customer service was good. Unfortunately the pizza was awful. It was super soggy. I'm not sure if it was because there was a delay getting here but no one in our party could handle more than 2 small square slices. I don't think we will be ordering there again. Btw: don't forget the pie." I liked the  previous  location better . They had us wait for 20 minutes  when the restaurant  was only half full. We ordered their cheesy bread. Which was good but could have used more garlic. We ordered their pizza.  It was a little  salty. I do like the crust however I was eating  my salad first and it got a little  soggy. Salad was nice and large and I was able to share. The service was average . We had to ask for refills Best in Phoenix imo. Words fail. "Hidden gem of the North Valley. THE PIZZA IS FANTASTIC - this is coming from a Chicago pizza snob  but not too sweet. Their Italian beef with giardiniera pizza is the best version I have had. It's clear that the Italian beef is made in-house.  The sweet sauce balances the spice in the giardiniera perfectly.  Thier sausage was good Great pizza.  It costs a little more than some places but well worth it.  I reccomend the signature pizza. My husband has been bringing home a calzone from work to home in GoldCanyon for years from Spinato's and it's always been very tasty. Today we dined in and had a meatball mushroom calzone and was one of the best I've eaten. Just enough sauce to compliment the perfect crust. Rob our server was very attentive and helpful in recommending the best way to purchase and get a calzone to go when you have such a distance to go. I will continue to get them to go but definitely the best way to appreciate their calzone is to dine in. Amazing food!! Wonderful service - tastes like true Chicago explosion in your mouth! We will be back again and again!!! "I have never had a pizza like this before.. It's definitely a unique family recipe!!!! It's like a sweet sauce kinda "Best pizza I've found. Their sauce and chocolate chip cookies are incredible. The cookies have like six ingredients. Good quality "I love Spinato's! You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorites list goes on... absolute favorites would be garlic bread with cheese (I don't know what they put on it that makes it so amazing) "Delicious food!!! Will definitely be coming back!! Everything I've tried here has been amazing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the waitress seemed angry the entire dinner. She smirked once after asking how our gluten-free bread was My boyfriend and I come here at least once a month. Food is amazing.  It gets busy from like 4-7 so we usually wait until after the rush so we can take our time.  Fridays they have $5 off a bottle of wine which is nice.  Great Happy Hour .The staff is very friendly and also helpful.I wish the bar was a little bigger but oh well" Spinato's combination of doing everything well ultimately results in some of the best pizza out there. I cannot recommend this place enough!" We had a fabulous pre theatre dinner here. The stuffed mushrooms were wonderful and the meatballs were the best I have had anywhere and I lived in Chicago for 30 years. Great waitress as well. Finally!! I've been trying to go here forever and I made it! This location definitely needs a makeover it's like stuck in the 80's. The bar had 4 stools and the place felt kinda sad. But I got carry out so didn't have to spend much time in there. The pizza was amazing sauce was a little sweet but I loved it. The thin crust isn't that thin and the cheese is not crappy Kraft.  drink specials and old fashion customer service make it what it is... Special !! They take pride in providing a great meal at a great price."  amazing pizza. This is my favorite pizza place!! We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer with vodka sauce. The best vodka sauce and meatballs ever.. I can't wait to come back!!" This is honestly the best pizza I've had since moving to Arizona in 2011. I'm telling you... this stuff is like crack. Trust me. Pay the extra couple bucks for for a large pie - it's about $20. You won't regret it. We had the Sicilian pizza and spaghetti calzone. Good stuff! Their cannoli was delicious too! Great place to eat...wonderful happy hour! We've tried several items on the menu. GOOD STUFF!!!  and it came with good old-fashion canned tomato sauce. This place sucks. Just go to Times Square and get the Pasta Giovani. That place is great." "This location is by far the best pizza in North Phoenix. If they sold wings they'd make my life complete. As is Spinatos Pizza is hands down one of the best Pizza I have ever eaten. Our family always order the large Hawaiian extra pineapple extra crispy. What makes their Pizza taste so good is the sauce. The sauce is perfect where it's not too sour and got a little bit of sweetness to it. This is our go to Pizza when we crave for pizza. Note that there are several locations and they are not created equally. The one is Tempe is really small with only a handful of tables. The one in Phoenix on 7th is huge but it's really missing the ""family pizzeria"" feel. This location on Bell is the best. Plenty of tables  been a faithful patron since the epiphany but wanted too throw out the Aurelio's name in case any other long time Phoenix folk had given up finding that taste."  the crust is thin and flaky. The green mango tea was delicious.Great sauce and fresh ingredients. The waitress we had didn't seem like she was having a good day "What is better than Spinato's delivery? The service & follow-up you get. When a mix-up occurred on an order In town from Charlotte and we were lucky to find this place. It was so so delicious!  We got the Big 6 (or something like that) and it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Try to get seated with Maria!!" Called a fourth time to ask where our food was...now an how and a half late....I'm now told its on way...yet girl who answered on my forth call to confirm delivery address gave me the wrong address yet again!!! This is rediculous and impressive..." The supreme pizza is packed with topping and very thin crust. Terrific pizza and around $15 for a large. Great combo Very nice waitress. The wait was a bit long but the pizza was worth it! The sweet sauce is delicious and a welcomed difference compared to other pizza places. Try the vanilla bean gelato alone or on any of the desserts!  we went here today to celebrate a birthday lunch and the service was absolutely terrible! I tried to secretly order a birthday treat for a birthday surprise. The naive hostess sent us a cannoli (we would have preferred cake.) Then the server announced it long before it arrived so it wasn't a surprise at all. To top it all off  how incredible their pizza is. I planned on picking up a couple pizzas on the way home from work. I call first at 6:45. An answering system says I'm 3rd in line. After 5 minutes it kicks me off and sends me to voice-mail. I tried again about 8 times within the next hour. Same thing. Except one of the times it said I was 2nd in line but I still got booted off after 5 minutes. Ridiculous! I totally understand that places get crazy busy. But they should have someone actually answer the frickin phone! Hire more people if they have to. I gave up around 7:45. I ordered from Isa's instead. Great pizza and they have the decency to answer their customers phone calls despite how busy they get." "Finally found a really good pizza in paradise valley and THEY DELIVER ! All the flavor you could ask for. I've only had a few different specialty pizza's here (chicken presto pesto & super six) but they were both excellent. Plenty of meat  this is one of the top fives for sure!!  We will be back again...if you haven't tried it you need to!!  This place does it right!"  cheesy garlic bread and also a thin crust pepperoni and sausage. Yes we were hungry!...so the apps came out first. The meatballs were delish! The sauce was so yummy and the garlic bread was good as usual. The pizza though...it was good....BUT Their sauce has a hint of sweetness that I really enjoyed and they don't skimp on the toppings. The crust is soft and perfectly chewy. I realize that's not everyone favorite but that's how I like it." The bar only seemed to have wine and beer. No cocktails. :(" This restraunt is a small little quaint pizzaria we waited abt 20 to 25 mins to get seated the service was great service Nick was our waiter and the manager was also great he was very friendly and helpful. Then to top it off we got the great six with hot peppers and garlic bread and a strawberry gorganzola salad . The pizza was by far the best pizza that I have ever had. It is a place I will be back to for sure. This is the best pizza we have ever had. Wow!!! We had the meat pizza and the mozzarella garlic bread that they serve with quality marinara sauce. We will definitely be back when we come to Arizona again! The service was also great! Great food! Pizza and Spaghetti Calzone was amazing! We will be back! Excellent sausage pizza and garlic cheese bread.  They use high quality ingredients and both items were perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be telling friends and business associates to eat here!! "Well seems they were closed for some reason. But there was an older person inside that had no problem knocking on the window as we put down something on there door so we could pull out our phones and see where else we could go eat lunch.  We were going to trash it after (I was going to make sure of it). No talking other then to bitch about what we had done and make sure it was removed. No information or sorry they were closed. Shame as I'm a local and had 3 new co-workers who wanted to try this usually great  place. Great 1st image you created for yourself and for the Valley with this attitude!! Even I might think twice now before going to this location maybe even all locations. Time to hire people who know customer service even if you were closed a ""I'm sorry we are closed due to.... We hope to welcome you back soon"" would of been a nice touch. Not happy."  the GF Mamma's Signature Pizza is to die for. I almost don't want to tell anyone. I add a couple pizza items to it. We are so hooked that if I could eat there 3 times a week and not get really big "Maybe my expectations were too high after hearing/reading the rave reviews. Soggy crust  REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV I didn't give this rating based on taste because I frankly hate Pizza Hut pizza. I think it's gross. The sandwiches and wings are great though. My fiance loves it all though. I like it because it is right next to our house and the staff are always friendly. I pick it up on my way home and if I get there early they try to get it for me as soon as they can.   your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not Do not order anything from this location...the store employees and managers are rude and simply don't care about customer satisfaction.  There are plenty of other options nearby that offer much better customer service. Since when it is OK to accept mediocrity as the norm? Do yourself a favor Pizza hut has a mere 4 different things on the menu (excluding variations). HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU BE OUT OF 3/4?! After going nowhere for five minutes I call exactly at 10:59 to place an order I go pick up my I take it back to have lunch this pizza is so salty. I couldn't eat it."  the maximum rating allowed by law for a Pizza Hut."  at a pretty good price.  Feels quite a bit like an old school neighborhood pizza parlor  and free breadsticks when you dine in. It can be a bit costly if you don't order from the list of specials. Keep an eye out for those and they often have coupons as well. If you call for delivery Poorly cooked pizza i will say that the people are somewhat nice when ordering but would not give this place another chance Cons: We do not go to the dinning room because of the small size.  Their subs on takeout do not rate very highly." They definitely do more take out business than sit down.  I would highly recommend Streets of NY for take out. Also "It got 4 stars but you have to know exactly what to get--and that is the #7 ""Best of Everything"" sandwich. Literally this is the only thing you should get here--everything else is pretty average Good pizza if you are a thin crust person like I am.  We did carry out. The staff was polite and the pizza was done when it was supposed to be. I'd go here often if I lived here. - just visiting! We absolutely love this Streets location.  Fantastic pizza and the antipasto salad is really incredible with all of the best ingredients. "This is the second time I've ordered from them. First time the pizza was awesome!!  This time it was very soggy!  Wigs on the other hand where delicious. I also go a slice of cheesecake to go. I paid $.85 for cherries. When I went to dive into my cheesecake the ""cherries"" that they gave me turned out to me ketchup. Gross. I called to tell them and their response was Do not order from this place the service sucks and the staff was clueless!" Disappointed.  I wanted bread w my pasta. Was told no. Even when menu says you get w dinner. I would have even paid. Server was just plain bad. Made me feel bad for wanting to look at menu. I almost got up to leave before I got food.  That bad.  Mariana was very bland. I can't get over how horrible this dish is. It's so bad I'm writing this review while eating it and the only reason I'm eating it is because I have a football game tonight and I need the carbs. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN"  but we gave this delivery a shot. Complete disappointment and rip off!! We should have stuck to our typical routine. We ordered a medium pizza and wings and the price was ridiculous for the quality and the portions. We paid the same amount for the delivery that we would at Oreganos and that includes beers. The cheese was rubbery and to be honest it taste the same as any other pizza place throughout the valley. Do yourself a favor and consider something else. I'm assuming that it's called Streets of NY because it's prices are up to par with NYC's cost of living. Complete let down. They must still owe Gonzo for the awful radio commercial I heard the other day. I apologize for the rant We only go for pizza about twice a year and this is the only place we go.  We have always had great food and great service.  Most people seem to take drive thru pickup or delivery so the inside is usually quiet and clean with great service.  (We have never done delivery service from this location) Had a pretty good pizza from here Totally messed up my order did not care it was crazy how much they did not care was kind of like hey you drove here so might as well take what we got You won't go wrong here"  but the salad had bacon all over it so I couldn't even eat it. The description didn't say there was bacon and it looked good so I was disappointed. Everything seemed fresh "I ordered a gluten-free pizza and a slice of chocolate cake over the phone. The hostess said it would be about 30 mins before I got my order delivered to my front door. 18 mins later "I noticed the prices on the menu on this application is not posted accurately.  Large X-cheese pizza was $20 I will definitely be back the next time I'm in this area!" I was just so disappointed since I usually love streets of New York but this location I will never come to again.  The burnt hot wings were one thing but cold pizza and bad service when we were the only customer in the place is just a waste of money.  but I really do not recommend that style of crust unless you want a cracker crust."  but they ran out--to my amazing  luck!  I then opted for the Italian wedding instead!!  Amazing!!  The meatballs were just the right size & so full of flavor.  Even their fries were delicious!  So  but this restaurant is not kept cool enough for my taste. The ice in the ice teas was melted by the time it arrived at the table. SONY would have gotten more stars at a lower temperature."
