 Andrea & Pete and each of them have displayed stellar customer service. I always feel confident leaving my car in their care. The major hail storm back in 2006 left my first ever Horrible place! Bad service! They make promises they can not keep. I dropped of my car and explained to them I needed my car by a certain date. I gave them 4 full business days to fix my car. They promised to call me and keep me updated and never did! I had to be the one constant calling them to get an update. I called my insurance company to let them know they are bad for business! They don't even deserve a 1 star!
