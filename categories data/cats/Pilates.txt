Phyliss is the only Iyengar certified teacher in Charlotte and is a true gem of a teacher.  If you want to learn about yoga or are just starting out this is a great place to start your practice.  If you are experienced or prefer another style of yoga  I've taken classes with each of the yoga teachers here and they are all really good at what they do. It's Iyengar style yoga Great instructors! I've taken pilates for over 15 years and hands down my favorite studio!  and then take your first left into where all of the brick buildings are. They are back left if you were standing on Fairview. I suggest leaving early for class the first time you go in case you get lost like me :) Alas "Wow!  This place is a class act.  Everyone is wonderful and so educated in their field. I have been taking another Barre Course for awhile now in Charlotte and was wondering why I kept getting injuries or feeling so horrible the next couple of days.  After taking the Corre Barre courses here  smart and effective movement.       Just a few weeks in as a newbie to Pilates (and nearly a newbie to exercise)  Melissa and Lisa teach from the heart...with great precision...passion...and years of experience.  Kinesphere rocks!"  they made each of us (with varying degrees of experience and different fitness levels) comfortable. I will definitely be returning to Kinesphere and highly recommend it."
